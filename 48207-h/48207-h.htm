<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In submitting this Book to the Public, I have
thought it best to give it precisely as it was left in
manuscript by my late Brother. His sudden death
in 1868 prevented the final revision which he still
contemplated.</p>

<p>The Notes may by some be thought unnecessarily
long, and in many instances they undoubtedly are
very discursive. Much labour, however, was expended
in their composition, in the hope, not merely
of giving a new interest to localities and incidents
already familiar to the resident, but also of affording
the numerous visitors to the charming region
which forms the theme of the Volume, an amount of
information supplementary to the mere outline which,
only, it is the province of a Guide Book, however
excellent, to supply.</p>

<p>The Work occupied for years the leisure hours of
a busy professional life; and the feelings with which
the Author entered upon and continued it, are best
expressed in those lines of Burns chosen by himself
for the motto.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The English Lake District may be said, in general
terms, to extend from Cross-Fell and the Solway
Firth, on the east and north, to the waters of Morecambe
and the Irish Sea; or, more accurately, to be
comprised within an irregular circle, varying from
forty to fifty miles in diameter, of which the centre
is the mountain Helvellyn, and within which are
included a great portion of Cumberland and Westmorland
and the northern extremity of Lancashire.</p>

<p>After the conquest of England by the Normans,
the counties of Cumberland and Westmorland, the
ancient inheritance of the Scottish Kings, as well as
the county of Northumberland, were placed by
William under the English crown. But the regions
thus alienated were not allowed to remain in the
undisturbed possession of the strangers. For a long
period they were disquieted by the attempts which
from time to time were made by successive kings of
Scotland to re-establish their supremacy over them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Supporting their pretensions by force of arms, they
carried war into the disputed territory, and conducted
it with a rancour and cruelty which spared neither
age or sex. The two nations maintained their cause,
just or unjust, with unfaltering resolution; or if they
seemed to hesitate for a moment, and a period of
settlement to be at hand, their frequent compromises
only ended in a renewal of their differences. Thus
these northern counties continued to pass alternately
under the rule of both the contending nations, until
the Scottish dominion over them was finally terminated
by agreement in the year 1237; Alexander of
Scotland accepting in lieu lands of a certain yearly
value, to be holden of the King of England by the
annual render of a falcon to the Constable of the
Castle of Carlisle, on the Festival of the Assumption.</p>

<p>The resumption, at no distant period, of the
manors which had been granted to Alexander,
renewed in all their strength the feelings of animosity
with which the Scots had been accustomed
to regard their southern neighbours, and the feuds
between the two kingdoms continued with unabated
violence for more than three centuries longer. The
dwellers in the unsettled districts lying along the
English and Scottish borders, being originally
derived from the same Celtic stock, had been
gradually and progressively influenced as a race by
the admixture of Saxon and Danish blood into the
population; and although much of the Celtic character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
was thereby lost, they seem to have retained
in their mountains and forests much of the spirit,
and many of the laws and manners, of the ancient
Britons. They continued to form themselves into
various septs, or clans, according to the Celtic custom;
sometimes banded together for the attainment
of a common end; and as often at feud, one clan
with another, when some act of personal wrong had
to be revenged upon a neighbouring community.
Thus a state of continual restlessness, springing out
of mutual hatred and jealousies, existed among the
borderers of either nation. The same feelings of
enmity were fostered, and the same system of petty
warfare was carried on, between the borderers of the
two kingdoms. Cumberland and Westmorland,
from their position, were subject to the frequent
inroads of the Scots; by whom great outrages were
committed upon the inhabitants. They drove their
cattle, burned their dwellings, plundered their monasteries,
and even destroyed whole towns and villages.
A barbarous system of vengeance and retaliation
ensued. Every act of violence and bloodshed was
perpetrated; whilst the most nefarious practices of
free-booting became the common occupation of the
marauding clans; and a <i>raid</i> into a neighbouring
district had for them the same sort of charm and
excitement which their descendants find in a modern
fox chase. Even after the union of the two kingdoms
under one sovereign, when the term "Borders"
had been changed to "Middle Shires," as being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
more suitable to a locality which was now nearly in
the centre of his dominions, the long cherished distinctions
and prejudices of the inhabitants were
maintained in all their vigour; and it required a
long period of conflict with these to be persevered
in, before the extinction of the border feuds could
be completely effected. These distractions have
now been at an end for more than two centuries.
The mountains look down upon a peaceful domain;
the valleys, everywhere the abode of quiet and
security, yield their rich pasturage to the herds, or
their corn-fields redden, though coyly, to the harvest;
and the population, much of it rooted in the soil,
and attached by hereditary ties to the same plots of
ancestral ground in many instances for six or seven
hundred years, is independent, prosperous, and
happy.</p>

<p>Some evidences of the old troublous times remain,
in the dismantled Border Towers, and moated or
fortified houses called Peles, which lie on the more
exposed parts of the district; in the ruins of the
conventual retreats; and in the crumbling strongholds
of the chiefs, which still retain something of a
past existence in the names which even yet cling
about their walls, as if the spirits of their former
possessors were reluctant to depart entirely from
them. Whilst a few traditions and recollections
survive of those stirring periods which have left
their mark upon the nation's history, and are
associated for ever with images of those illustrious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
persons whose familiar haunts were within the
shadows of the hills.</p>

<p>But the great charm of this region, which is not
without attractions also of a superstitious and
romantic character, lies in the variety of the
aspects of nature which it presents; exhibiting,
on a diminutive scale, combinations of the choicest
features of the scenery of all those lands which
have a name and fame for beauty and magnificence.
Mr. West, a Roman Catholic clergyman, long resident
in the district, and the author of one of the
earliest Guides to the Lakes, thus expresses himself:
"They who intend to make the continental tour
should begin here; as it will give in miniature, an
idea of what they are to meet with there, in
traversing the Alps and Appenines: to which our
northern mountains are not inferior in beauty of
line, or variety of summit, number of lakes, and
transparency of water; not in colouring of rock
or softness of turf; but in height and extent
only. The mountains here are all accessible to the
summit, and furnish prospects no less surprising,
and with more variety than the Alps themselves."
Wordsworth also, who could well judge of this fact,
and none better; he who for fifty years</p>

<div class="poem">
"Murmured near <i>these</i> running brooks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A music sweeter than their own,"</span><br />
</div>

<p>and looked on all their changing phases with a
superstitious eye of love; after he had become
acquainted with the mountain scenery of Wales,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
Scotland, Switzerland, and Italy, gave his judgment
that, as a whole, the English Lake District within
its narrow limits is preeminent above them all. He
thus speaks: "A happy proportion of component
parts is indeed noticeable among the landscapes of
the North of England; and, in this characteristic
essential to a perfect picture, they surpass the
scenes of Scotland, and, in a still greater degree,
those of Switzerland.... On the score even of
sublimity, the superiority of the Alps is by no means
so great as might hastily be inferred; and, as to the
<i>beauty</i> of the lower regions of the Swiss mountains,
their surface has nothing of the mellow tone and
variety of hues by which our mountain turf is
distinguished.... The Lakes are much more
interesting than those of the Alps; first, as is
implied above by being more happily proportioned
to the other features of the landscape; and next,
as being infinitely more pellucid, and less subject
to agitation from the winds." And again, "The
water of the English Lakes being of a crystalline
clearness, the reflections of the surrounding hills are
frequently so lively, that it is scarcely possible to
distinguish the point where the real object terminates,
and its unsubstantial duplicate begins."</p>

<p>It is therefore not to be wondered at, that during
the greater part of a century, where the old Border
<i>raids</i> of violence have ceased, excursions of a very
different character should have taken their place.
Every summer brings down upon the valleys clouds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
of visitors from every corner of our island, and from
many countries of Europe and America, eager to
enjoy their freshness and beauty, and breathe a new
life in the companionship of the lakes and hills.
And if in a spirit somewhat more akin to the moss-trooping
Borderer of an earlier time, an occasional
intruder has scoured the vales in search of their
traditions; and in the pursuit of these has ransacked
their annals, plundered their guides, and levied a
sort of black-mail upon even casual and anonymous
contributors to their history; it may in some degree
extenuate the offence to remember that such literary
free-booting makes no one poorer for what it takes
away; and that the <i>opima spolia</i> of the adventurer
are only so much gathered to be distributed again.
More especially to the Notes which constitute so
large a portion of the present Volume may this
remark be applied. Scenery long outlasts all
traditional and historical associations. To revive
these among their ancient haunts, and to awaken
yet another interest in this land of beauty, has been
the aim and end of this modern <i>Raid</i> into the
valleys of the North, and the regions that own the
sovereignty of the "mighty Helvellyn."</p>

<h2>THE PAST.<br />
(IN SIGHT OF DACRE CASTLE.)</h2>

<div class="poem">
Through yon old archway grey and broken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rides forth a belted knight;</span><br />
Upon his breast his true-love's token<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And armour glittering bright.</span><br />
<br />
His arm a fond adieu is waving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And answering waves a hand</span><br />
From one whose love her grief is braving&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fairest of the land.</span><br />
<br />
The trumpet calls, and plain and valley<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Give forth their armed men;</span><br />
And round the red-cross flag they rally,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From every dale and glen.</span><br />
<br />
And she walks forth in silent sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who was so blest to-day,</span><br />
And thinks on many a lone to-morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In those old towers of grey.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span><br />
From many a piping throat so mellow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The joyful song bursts forth:</span><br />
On many a field the corn so yellow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes golden bright the earth.</span><br />
<br />
And mountains o'er the green woods frowning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Close round the banner'd walls;</span><br />
While mid-day sunshine, all things crowning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In summer splendour falls.</span><br />
<br />
But ours is not the age they walk in;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It is the years of yore:</span><br />
And ours is not the tongue they talk in;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis language used no more.</span><br />
<br />
Yet many an eye in silence bending<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er this unmurmur'd lay,</span><br />
Beholds that knight the vale descending,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And feels that summer's day.</span><br />
<br />
Lives it then not? Yes; and when hoary<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath our years we stand,</span><br />
That scene of summer, love, and glory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall still be on the land.</span><br />
<br />
Truth from the earth itself shall perish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere that shall be no more;</span><br />
The heart in song will ever cherish<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What has been life of yore.</span><br />

<h2>THE BANNER OF BROUGHTON TOWER.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The knight looked out from Broughton Tower;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The stars hung high o'er Broughton Town;</span><br />
"There should be tidings by this hour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Fouldrey Pile or Urswick Down!"</span><br />
<br />
Far out the Duddon roll'd its tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath; and on the verge afar,</span><br />
The Warder through the night descried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beacon, like a rising star.</span><br />
<br />
It told that Fouldrey by the sea<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was signall'd from the ships that bore,</span><br />
With Swart's Burgundian chivalry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The false King from the Irish shore.</span><br />
<br />
And Lincoln's Earl, and Broughton's Knight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And brave Lord Lovel, wait the sign</span><br />
To march their hosts to Urswick's height,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hail him King, of Edward's line.</span><br />
<br />
Brave men as ever swerv'd aside!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But faithful to their ancient fame,</span><br />
The white Rose wooed them in her pride<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once more; and foremost forth they came.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><br />
The Knight looked out beneath his hand;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Warder pointed to the glow;</span><br />
"Now droop my banner, that my band<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May each embrace it! then we'll go.</span><br />
<br />
"And if we fall, as fall we may,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thus resolute the wronged to raise,</span><br />
The banner that we bear to-day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall be our monument and praise!"</span><br />
<br />
One look into his lady's bower;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One step into his ancient hall;</span><br />
And then adieu to Broughton Tower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till blooms the white Rose over all!</span><br />
<br />
High o'er the surge of many a fight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That banner, for the Rose, had led</span><br />
The liegemen of the Broughton knight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To victory's smiles, or glory's bed.</span><br />
<br />
And 'twas a glorious sight to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That break of day, from tower and town,</span><br />
Pour forth his martial tenantry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To swell the array on Urswick Down:</span><br />
<br />
To see the glancing pennons wave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above them, and the banner borne</span><br />
All joyously by warriors, brave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As ever hailed a battle morn.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><br />
And 'twas a stirring sound to hear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Uprolling from the camp,&mdash;the drum,</span><br />
The music, and the martial cheer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That told the chiefs, "We come, we come!"</span><br />
<br />
Then in that sunny time of June,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When green leaves burdened every spray,</span><br />
With all the merry birds in tune,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They marched upon their southward way.</span><br />
<br />
And, as through channel'd sands afar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tides with steady onward force</span><br />
Push inland, roll'd their wave of war<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Trent, its unresisted course.</span><br />
<br />
And spreading wide its crest where Stoke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'erlook'd the Royal lines below,</span><br />
Spent its long gathering strength, and broke,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plung'd in fury on the foe.</span><br />
<br />
For three long hours that summer morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">King Henry by his standard rode,</span><br />
Through onset and repulse upborne,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A tower of strength where'er it glowed.</span><br />
<br />
For three long hours the fated band<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of chiefs, that summer morning waged</span><br />
A desperate battle, hand to hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where'er the thickest carnage raged,</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span><br />
Till midst four thousand liegemen slain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The flower of that misguided host,</span><br />
Borne down upon the fatal plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fame, honour, life, and cause were lost.</span><br />
<br />
Turn ye, who high in hall and tower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sit waiting for your lords, and burn</span><br />
To wrest the tidings of that hour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From lips that never may return:</span><br />
<br />
Turn inwards from the news that flies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through England's summer groves, and close</span><br />
The circlets of your asking eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the coming cloud of woes!</span><br />
<br />
Wild rumour, like the wind that wings,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">None knows or how or whence, its way,</span><br />
Storm-like on Broughton's turret rings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dire disaster of that day.</span><br />
<br />
Storm-like through his dislorded halls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And farmsteads lone, the rumour breaks;</span><br />
And far by Witherslack's grey walls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hamlet cots, despair awakes.</span><br />
<br />
And all old things meet shock and change,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since Broughton, down-borne in his pride</span><br />
On that red field, no more shall range<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By Duddon's rocks, or Winster's side.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span><br />
And while the hills around rejoiced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in the triumph of their King</span><br />
Old strains of peace sang trumpet-voiced,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bade the landscapes smile and sing;</span><br />
<br />
Far stretching o'er the land, his sign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The King from Broughton's charters tore;</span><br />
And the old honours of his line<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In his old tower were known no more.</span><br />
<br />
His halls, his manors, his fair lands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pass'd from his name; round all he'd loved,</span><br />
And all that loved him, power's dread hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In shadow through the noontide moved:</span><br />
<br />
E'en to those cottage homes apart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His poor men's huts by lonely ways&mdash;</span><br />
To crush from out the humblest heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each pulse that dared to throb his praise!</span><br />
<br />
But when old feuds had all been healed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And England's long lost smiling years</span><br />
Returned, and tales of Stoke's red field<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair eyes had ceased to flood with tears;</span><br />
<br />
'Twas whispered 'mid the fields and farms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That once were Broughton's free domain,&mdash;</span><br />
His <i>banner</i>, saved from strife of arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was somewhere 'mid those homes again.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
That o'er the hills afar, where lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lone Witherslack by moorland roads,</span><br />
His own old liegemen true the prize<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Held fast within their safe abodes.</span><br />
<br />
Thrice honour'd in that matchless zeal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To brave proscription, death and shame;</span><br />
Thus rescued by their hearths to feel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The symbol of his ancient fame!</span><br />
<br />
So for old faithfulness renowned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tenants of that knightly race</span><br />
Their age-long acts of service crowned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With that last deed of loyal grace.</span><br />
<br />
Last? Nay! for on one Sabbath morn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An old man, blanch'd by years and cares,</span><br />
Gave up his spirit, tired and worn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amidst those humble liegemen's prayers.</span><br />
<br />
Gave up a long secreted life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Mid hinds and herds, by peasant maids</span><br />
Nurtured and soothed, while shadows rife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With death's stern edicts, stalked the glades.</span><br />
<br />
He pass'd while Cartmel's monks sang dole,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As for a brave man gone to rest;</span><br />
And men sighed, "Glory to his soul!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wrapt the banner round his breast:</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><br />
And placed the tassell'd bridle reins<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And spurs that, by his lattice, led</span><br />
His thoughts so oft to far off plains,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside him in his narrow bed:</span><br />
<br />
And borne on high their arms above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As hinds are borne to churchyard cells,</span><br />
With kindly speech of truth and love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Mix'd with the sound of mournful bells,</span><br />
<br />
They laid him in a tomb, engraved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With no memorial, date, or name;</span><br />
But one dear relic round him, saved<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To whisper in the earth his fame.</span><br />
<br />
And when that age had all gone down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To mingle with its native dust,</span><br />
And time his deeds had overgrown,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His banner yielded up its trust;</span><br />
<br />
And told from one low chancel's shade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where good men sang on holy days&mdash;</span><br />
"Here Broughton's Knight in earth was laid.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace! To his tenants, endless praise!"</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE BANNER OF BROUGHTON
TOWER."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Broughton Tower, the ancient part of which is all that
remains of the residence of the unfortunate Sir Thomas
Broughton, stands a little to the eastward of the town of that
name, upon the neck of a wooded spur of land, which projects
from the high ground above the houses towards the river
Duddon, about a mile distant. The towered portion, as it
rises from the wood, has much of the appearance of a church;
but is in reality part of the ancient building, now connected
with a modern mansion. It has a southern aspect, with a
slope down to the river, being well sheltered in the opposite
direction. "It commands an extensive view, comprising in a
wonderful variety hill and dale, water, wooded grounds, and
buildings; whilst fertility around is gradually diminished, being
lost in the superior heights of Black Comb, in Cumberland,
the high lands between Kirkby and Ulverston, and the estuary
of the Duddon expanding into the sands and waters of the
Irish sea."</p>

<p>The Broughtons were an Anglo-Saxon family of high
antiquity, in whose possession the manor of Broughton had
remained from time immemorial, and whose chief seat was at
Broughton, until the second year of the reign of Henry the
Seventh. At this period the power and interest of Sir Thomas
Broughton were so considerable, that the Duchess of Burgundy,
sister to the late King and the Duke of Clarence,
relied on him as one of the principal confederates in the
attempt to subvert the government of Henry by the pretensions
of Lambert Simnel.</p>

<p>Ireland was zealously attached to the house of York, and
held in affectionate regard the memory of the Duke of
Clarence, the Earl of Warwick's father, who had been its
lieutenant. No sooner, therefore, did the impostor Simnel
present himself to Thomas Fitz-Gerald, Earl of Kildare, and
claim his protection as the unfortunate Warwick, than that
credulous nobleman paved the way for his reception, and
furthered his design upon the throne, till the people in Dublin
with one consent tendered their allegiance to him as the true
Plantagenet. They paid the pretended Prince attendance as
their sovereign, lodged him in the Castle of Dublin, crowned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>him with a diadem taken from a statue of the Virgin, and
publicly proclaimed him King, by the appellation of Edward
the Sixth.</p>

<p>In the year 1487 Lambert, with about two thousand
Flemish troops under the command of Colonel Martin Swart,
a man of noble family in Germany, an experienced and valiant
soldier, whom the Duchess of Burgundy had chosen to support
the pretended title of Simnel to the crown of England, and a
number of Irish, conducted by Thomas Gerardine their captain
from Ireland, landed in Furness at the Pile of Fouldrey. The
army encamped in the neighbourhood of Ulverston, at a place
now known by the name of Swart-Moor. Sir Thomas
Broughton joined the rebels with a small body of English.
The army, at this time about eight thousand strong, proceeded
to join the Earl of Lincoln, Lord Lovel, and the rest of the
confederates, passing on through Cartmel to Stoke field, near
Newark-upon-Trent, where they met and encountered the
King's forces on the 5th of June, 1487.</p>

<p>The day being far advanced before the King arrived at
Stoke, he pitched his camp and deferred the battle till the
day following. The forces of the Earl of Lincoln also encamped
at a little distance from those of the King, and
undismayed by the superior numbers they had to encounter,
bravely entered the field the next day, and arranged themselves
for battle, according to the directions of Colonel Swart and
other superior officers. The charge being sounded, a desperate
conflict was maintained with equal valour on both sides for
three hours. The Germans were in every respect equal to the
English, and none surpassed the bravery of Swart their commander.
For three hours each side contended for victory,
and the fate of the battle remained doubtful. The Irish
soldiers, however, being badly armed, and the Germans being
overpowered by numbers, the Lambertines were at length
defeated, but not before their principal officers, the Earl of
Lincoln, Lord Lovel, <i>Sir Thomas Broughton</i>, Colonel Swart,
and Sir Thomas Gerardine captain of the Irish, and upwards
of four thousand of their soldiers were slain.</p>

<p>Young Lambert and his tutor were both taken prisoners.
The latter, being a priest, was punished with perpetual
imprisonment; Simnel was too contemptible to be an object
either of apprehension or resentment to Henry. He was
pardoned, and made a scullion in the King's kitchen, whence
he was afterwards advanced to the rank of falconer, in which
employment he ended his days.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Broughton is said to have fallen on the field of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>battle: but there remains a tradition, that he returned and
lived many years amongst his tenants in Witherslack, in Westmorland;
and was interred in the Chapel there; but of this
nothing is known for certain at present, or whether he returned
or where he died. Dr. Burn, speaking of the grant of Witherslack
to Sir Thomas, on the attainder of the Harringtons in
the first year of Henry's reign for siding with the house of
York, and of its subsequent grant to Thomas Lord Stanley,
the first Earl of Derby, on the attainder of Sir Thomas for
having been concerned in this affair of Lambert Simnel, goes
on to say&mdash;"And here it may not be amiss to rectify a mistake
in Lord Bacon's history of that King, (Henry VII.) who saith
that this Sir Thomas Broughton was slain at Stoke, near
Newark, on the part of the counterfeit Plantagenet, Lambert
Simnell; whereas Sir Thomas Broughton escaped from that
battle hither into Witherslack, where he lived a good while
<i>incognito</i>, amongst those who had been his tenants, who were
so kind unto him as privately to keep and maintain him, and
who dying amongst them was buried by them, whose grave Sir
Daniel Fleming says in his time was to be seen there."</p>

<p>The erection of the new chapel of Witherslack by Dean
Barwick, in 1664, at a considerable distance from where the
ancient chapel stood, has obliterated the memory of his once
well-known grave. With this unhappy gentleman the family
of Broughton, which had flourished for many centuries and
had contracted alliances with most of the principal families in
these parts, was extinguished in Furness.</p>

<p>After these affairs the King had leisure to revenge himself
on his enemies, and made a progress into the northern parts
of England, where he gave many proofs of his rigorous disposition.
A strict inquiry was made after those who had
assisted or favoured the rebels, and heavy fines and even
sanguinary punishments, were imposed upon the delinquents
in a very arbitrary manner. The fidelity therefore of Sir
Thomas Broughton's tenants to their fallen master was not
without its dangers, and is a pleasing instance of attachment
to the person of a leader in a rude and perilous age.</p>

<p>In the wars of the Roses the Broughtons had always
strenuously supported the House of York. It is however
remarkable that, the manor of Witherslack having been
granted to Sir Thomas by Henry the Seventh in the first
year of his reign, he should have joined the Pretender in arms
against that monarch in the following year.</p>

<p>Methop and Ulva, though distinctly named in the title
and description of this manor, yet make but a small part of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>They are all included within a peninsula, as it were, between
Winster Beck, Bryster Moss, and Lancaster Sands.</p>

<p>The fate of Lord Lovel, another of the chiefs in this
disastrous enterprise, is also shrouded in mystery. It has
often been told that he was never seen, living or dead, after
the battle.</p>

<p>The dead bodies of the Earl of Lincoln and most of the other
principal leaders, it was said, were found where they had fallen,
sword-in-hand, on the fatal field; but not that of Lord Lovel.
Some assert that he was drowned when endeavouring to escape
across the river Trent, the weight of his armour preventing
the subsequent discovery of his body. Other reports apply to
him the circumstances similar to those which have been related
above as referring to Sir Thomas Broughton; namely, that he
fled to the north where, under the guise of a peasant, he
ended his days in peace. Lord Bacon, in his History of
Henry the Seventh, says "that he lived long after in a cave
or vault." And his account has been partly corroborated in
modern times. William Cowper, Esquire, Clerk of the
House of Commons, writing from Hertingfordbury Park in
1738, says&mdash;"In 1708, upon the occasion of new laying a
chimney at Minster Lovel, there was discovered a large vault
or room underground in which was the entire skeleton of a
man, as having been sitting at a table which was before him,
with a book, paper, pen, etc.; in another part of the room
lay a cap, all much mouldered and decayed; which the family
and others judged to be this Lord Lovel, whose exit has
hitherto been so uncertain."</p>

<p>A tradition was rife in the village in the last century to the
effect that, in this hiding place, which could only be opened
from the exterior, the insurgent chief had confided himself to
the care of a female servant, was forgotten or neglected by her,
and consequently died of starvation.</p>

<p>The ancient Castle or Pile of Fouldrey, (formerly called
Pele of Foudra, or Futher,) stands upon a small island near
the southern extremity of the isle of Walney; and is said by
Camden to have been built by an Abbot of Furness, in the
first year of King Edward the Third (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1327). It was
probably intended for an occasional retreat from hostility; a
depository for the valuable articles of the Monastery of Furness;
and for a fortress to protect the adjoining harbour; all
which intentions its situation and structure were well calculated
to answer at the time of its erection.</p>

<p>It seems to have been the custom in the northern parts of
the kingdom, for the monasteries to have a fortress of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>kind, in which they might lodge with security their treasure
and records on the approach of an enemy; of this the Castle
on Holy Island, in Northumberland, and Wulstey Castle, near
the Abbey of Holm Cultram, in Cumberland, are examples.
It has even been said that an underground communication
existed between Furness Abbey and the Pele of Fouldrey.</p>

<p>The harbour alluded to, appears to have been of considerable
importance to the shipping of that period, when the relations
of Ireland with the monks had become established. In the reign
of Henry the Sixth, it is mentioned as being found a convenient
spot for the woollen merchants to ship their goods to Ernemouth,
in Zealand, without paying the duty; and in Elizabeth's
days as "the only good haven for great shippes to londe or
ryde in" between Scotland and Milford Haven, in Wales.</p>

<p>It was apprehended that the Spanish Armada would try to
effect a landing in this harbour.</p></blockquote>

<h3>NOTE.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The rock thus named, lies off the harbour at Harrington,
on the coast of Cumberland, and is only visible at low water
during spring tides.</p>

<p>The Gleemen, or Waits, as the Christmas minstrels are
called, still keep up their annual rounds, with song and salutation,
and with a heartiness and zeal, which have been well
described by the great Poet of the Lake district in those
feeling and admirable verses to his brother, Dr. Wordsworth,
prefixed to his Sonnets on the River Duddon.</p>

<p>In the parish of Muncaster, on the eve of the new year, the
children go from house to house, singing a ditty, which craves
the bounty, "<i>they were wont to have, in old king Edward's
days</i>." There is no tradition whence this custom arose; the
donation is two-pence or a pie at every house. Mr. Jefferson
suggests, may not the name have been altered from Henry to
Edward? and may it not have an allusion to the time when
King Henry the sixth was entertained at Muncaster Castle in
his flight from his enemies?</p></blockquote>

<h2>CRIER OF CLAIFE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
A wild holloa on Wynander's shore,<br />
'Mid the loud waves' splash and the night-wind's roar!<br />
Who cries so late with desperate note,<br />
Far over the water, to hail the boat?<br />
<br />
'Tis night's mid gloom; the strong rain beats fast:<br />
Is there one at this hour will face the blast,<br />
And the darkness traverse with arm and oar,<br />
To ferry the Crier from yonder shore?<br />
<br />
A mile to cross, and the skies so dread;<br />
With a storm around that would wake the dead;<br />
And fathoms of boiling depths below;<br />
The ferry is hailed, and the boat must go.<br />
<br />
Snug under that cliff, whence over the Mere,<br />
When summer is merry and skies are clear,<br />
In holiday times hearts light and gay<br />
Look over the hills and far away&mdash;<br />
<br />
At the Ferry-house Inn, sat warm beside<br />
The bright wood-fire and hearthstone wide,<br />
A rollicking band of jovial souls<br />
With tinkling cans and full brown bowls.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><br />
Without, the sycamores' branches rode<br />
The storm, as if fiends the roof bestrode;<br />
Yet stout of heart, to that wild holloa<br />
The ferryman smiled&mdash;"The boat must go."<br />
<br />
His comrades followed out into the dark,<br />
As the young man strode to the tumbling bark;<br />
And, wishing him luck in the perilous storm,<br />
With a shudder went back to the fireside warm.<br />
<br />
An hour is gone! against wind and wave<br />
Well struggled and strove that heart so brave.<br />
Another! they crowd to the whistling door,<br />
To welcome the guide and his freight to shore.<br />
<br />
But pallid, and stunn'd, aghast, alone,<br />
He stood in the boat, and speech had none:<br />
His lips were locked, and his eyes astare,<br />
And blanched with terror his manly hair.<br />
<br />
What thing he had seen, what utterance heard,<br />
What horror that night his senses stirr'd,<br />
Was frozen within him, and choked his breath,<br />
And laid him, ere morning, cold in death.<br />
<br />
But what that night of horror revealed,<br />
And what that night of horror concealed<br />
Of spirits and powers in storms that roam,<br />
Lies hid with the monk in St. Mary's Holm.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><br />
Still, under the cliff&mdash;whence over the Mere,<br />
When summer was merry and skies were clear,<br />
In holiday times hearts light and gay<br />
Looked over the hills and far away&mdash;<br />
<br />
When the rough winds blew amid rain and cold,<br />
The Ferry-house gathered its hearts of old,<br />
Who sat at the hearth and o'er the brown ale,<br />
Oft talked of that night and its dismal tale.<br />
<br />
And often the Crier was heard to wake<br />
The night's foul echoes across the lake;<br />
But never again would a hand unmoor<br />
The boat, to venture by night from shore:<br />
<br />
Till they sought the good monk of St. Mary's Holm,<br />
With relics of saints and beads from Rome,<br />
To row to the Nab on Hallowmas night,<br />
And bury the Crier by morning's light.<br />
<br />
With Aves muttered, and spells unknown,<br />
The monk rows over the Mere alone;<br />
Like a feather his bark floats light and fast;<br />
When the Crier's loud hail sweeps down the blast.<br />
<br />
Speed on, bold heart, with gifts of grace!<br />
He is nearing the wild fiend-blighted place.<br />
Now heed thee, foul spirit! the priest has power<br />
To bind thee on earth till the morning hour.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span><br />
He rests his oars; and the faint blue gleam<br />
From a marsh-light sheds on the ground its beam.<br />
There's a stir in the grass; and there's <span class="smcap">ONE</span> on a knoll,<br />
Unearthly and horrid to sight and soul.<br />
<br />
That horrible cry rings through the dark,<br />
As the monk steps out of the grounding bark;<br />
And he charms a circle around the knoll,<br />
Wherein he must sit till the mass bell toll.<br />
<br />
Then over the lake, with the fiend in tow,<br />
To the quarry beyond the monk will go,<br />
And bury the Crier with book and bell,<br />
While the birds of morning sing him farewell.<br />
<br />
The morn awoke. As the breezy smile<br />
Of dawn played over St. Mary's Isle,<br />
The tinkling sound of the mass-bell rose,<br />
And startled the valleys from brief repose.<br />
<br />
Then, like a speck from afar descried,<br />
The monk row'd out on the waters wide&mdash;<br />
From the Nab row'd out, with the fiend in his wake,<br />
To lay him in quiet, across the lake.<br />
<br />
And fear-struck men, and women that bore<br />
Their babes, beheld from height and shore,<br />
How he reached the wood that hid the dell,<br />
Where he laid the Crier with book and bell.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span><br />
"For the ivy green" the spell was told;<br />
"For the ivy green" his knell was knoll'd;<br />
That as long as by wall and greenwood tree<br />
The ivy flourished, his rest might be.<br />
<br />
So did the good monk; and thus was laid<br />
The Crier in ground by greenwood shade.<br />
In the quarry of Claife the wretched ghost<br />
To human ear for ever was lost.<br />
<br />
And country folk in peace again<br />
Went forth by night through field and lane,<br />
Nor dreaded to hear that terrible note<br />
Cry over the water, and hail the boat.<br />
<br />
And still on that cliff, high over the Mere,<br />
When summer is merry, and skies are clear,<br />
In holiday times hearts light and gay<br />
Look over the hills and far away.<br />
<br />
But what that night of horror revealed,<br />
And what that night and morrow concealed,<br />
Of spirits so wicked and given to roam,<br />
Lies hid with the monk in St. Mary's Holm.<br />
<br />
Peace be with him, peaceful soul!<br />
Long his bell has ceased to toll.<br />
Green the Isle that folds his breast;<br />
Clear the Lake that lull'd his rest.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><br />
Though the many ages gone<br />
Long have left his place unknown;<br />
Yet where once he kneel'd and pray'd,<br />
By his altar long decay'd,<br />
Stranger to this Island led!<br />
Humbly speak and softly tread;<br />
Catching from the ages dim<br />
This, the burden of his hymn:&mdash;<br />
<br />
"Ave, Thou before whose name<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrath and shadows swiftly flee!</span><br />
Arm Thy faithful bands with flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Earth from foulest foes to free.</span><br />
<br />
"Peace on all these valleys round,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathe from out this Islet's breast;</span><br />
Wafting from this holy ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seeds of Thy eternal rest.</span><br />
<br />
"Wrath and Evil, then no more<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here molesting, all shall cease.</span><br />
Peace around! From shore to shore&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace! On all Thy waters&mdash;peace!"</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "CRIER OF CLAIFE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The little rocky tree-decked islet in Windermere, called
St. Mary's, or the Ladye's Holme, hitherto reputed to have
formed part of the conventual domains of the Abbey at
Furness, had its name from a chantry dedicated to the Virgin
Mary, which was standing up to the reign of King Henry the
Eighth, but of which no traces are now remaining. "When,"
says an anonymous writer, "at the Reformation, that day of
desolation came, which saw the attendant priests driven forth,
and silenced for ever the sweet chant of orison and litany
within its walls; the isle and revenues of the institution were
sold to the Philipsons of Calgarth. By them the building
was suffered to fall into so utter a state of ruin, that no trace
even of its foundations is left to proclaim to the stranger who
meditates upon the fleeting change of time and creed, that
here, for more than three centuries, stood a hallowed fane,
from whence at eventide and prime prayers were wafted
through the dewy air, where now are only heard the festal
sounds of life's more jocund hours." Lately renewed antiquarian
investigation has, however, disclosed the erroneousness
of the generally received statement respecting the early ownership
of this tiny spot; as in Dodsworth's celebrated collection
of ancient evidences there is contained an Inquisition, or the
copy of one, taken at Kendal, so far back as the Monday after
the feast of the Annunciation, in the 28th Edward the Third,
which shews that this retreat, amid the waters of our English
Como, appertained not to Furness Abbey, but to the house of
Segden, in Scotland, which was bound always to provide two
resident chaplains for the service of our Ladye's Chapel in
this island solitude. For the maintenance and support of those
priests, certain lands were given by the founder, who was
either one of that chivalrous race, descended from the Scottish
Lyndseys "light and gay," whose immediate ancestor in the
early part of the thirteenth century had married Alice, second
daughter and co-heiress of William de Lancaster, eighth Lord
of Kendal; and with her obtained that moiety of the Barony
of Kendal, whose numerous manors are collectively known
as the Richmond Fee; or the chantry may have owed its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>foundation to the pious impulses of Ingelram de Guignes,
Sire de Courci, one of the grand old Peers of France, whose
house, so renowned in history and romance, proclaimed its
independence and its pride in this haughty motto:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Je ne suis Roy ni Prince aussi,<br />
Je suis Le Seignhor de Courci."<br />
</div>

<p>And which Ingelram in 1285 married Christiana, heiress of
the last de Lyndsey, and in her right, besides figuring on
innumerable occasions as a feudal potentate, both in England
and Scotland, he became Lord of the Fee, within which lies
St. Mary's Isle.</p>

<p>On an Inquisition taken after the death of Johanna de
Coupland, in the 49th Edward the Third, it was found that
she held the advowson of the Chapel of Saint Mary's Holme,
within the lake of Wynandermere, but that it was worth
nothing, because the land which the said Chapel enjoyed of
old time had been seized into the hands of the King, and lay
within the park of Calgarth. It is on record, however, that
in 1492, an annual sum of six pounds was paid out of the
revenues of the Richmond Fee, towards the support of the
Chaplains; and in the returns made by the ecclesiastical
Commissioners in Edward the Sixth's reign, "the free Chapel
of Holme and Wynandermere" is mentioned, shortly after
which it was granted, as aforesaid, to the owners of Calgarth.</p>

<p>The singular name of the "Crier of Claife" is now applied
to an extensive slate or flag quarry, long disused, and overgrown
with wood, on the wildest and most lonely part of the
height called Latter-barrow, which divides the vales of Esthwaite
and Windermere, above the Ferry. In this desolate
spot, by the sanctity and skill of holy men, had been exorcised
and laid the apparition who had come to be known throughout
the country by that title; and the place itself has ever since
borne the same name. None of the country people will go
near it after night fall, and few care to approach it even in
daylight. Desperate men driven from their homes by domestic
discord, have been seen going in its direction, and never known
to return. It is said the Crier is allowed to emerge occasionally
from his lonely prison, and is still heard on very stormy
nights sending his wild entreaty for a boat, howling across
Windermere. Mr. Craig Gibson, in one of his graphic
sketches of the Lake country, says that he is qualified to speak
to this, for he himself has heard him. "At least," says he, "I
have heard what I was solemnly assured by an old lady at
Cunsey must have been the Crier of Claife. Riding down
the woods a little south of the Ferry, on a wild January
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>evening, I was strongly impressed by a sound made by the
wind as, after gathering behind the hill called Gummershow
for short periods of comparative calm, it came rushing up and
across the lake with a sound startlingly suggestive of the cry
of a human being in extremity, wailing for succour. This
sound lasted till the squall it always preceded struck the
western shore, when it was lost in the louder rush of the wind
through the leafless woods. I am induced to relate this," he
continues, "by the belief I entertain that the phenomenon
described thus briefly and imperfectly, may account for much
of the legend, and that the origin of many similar traditional
superstitions may be found in something equally simple."</p>

<p>The late Mr. John Briggs, in his notes upon "Westmorland
as it was," by the Rev. Mr. Hodgson, has furnished his
readers with some curious information upon the "philosophy
of spirits," which he collected from those ancient sages of the
dales who were supposed to be best acquainted with the
subject. Many of these superstitions are now exploded: but
the marvellous tales at one time currently believed, still furnish
conversation for the cottage fireside. According to the gravest
authorities, he says, no spirit could appear before twilight had
vanished in the evening, or after it had appeared in the
morning. On this account, the winter nights were peculiarly
dangerous, owing to the long revels which ghosts, or dobbies,
as they were called, could keep at that season. There was
one exception to this. If a man had murdered a woman who
was with child by him, she had power to haunt him at all
hours; and the Romish priests (who alone had the power of
laying spirits,) could not lay a spirit of this kind with any
certainty, as she generally contrived to break loose long before
her stipulated time. A culprit might hope to escape the
gallows, but there was no hope of escaping being haunted.
In common cases, however, the priest could "lay" the ghosts;
"while ivy was green," was the usual term. But in very
desperate cases, they were laid in the "Red Sea," which was
accomplished with great difficulty and even danger to the
exorcist. In this country, the most usual place to confine
spirits was under Haws Bridge, a few miles below Kendal.
Many a grim ghost has been chained in that dismal trough!</p>

<p>According to the laws to which they were subject, ghosts
could seldom appear to more than one person at a time.
When they appeared to the eyes, they had not the power of
making a noise; and when they saluted the ear, they could
not greet the eyes. To this, however, there was an exception,
when a human being spoke to them in the name of the Blessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>Trinity. For it was an acknowledged truth, that however
wicked the individual might have been in this world, or however
light he might have made of the Almighty's name, he
would tremble at its very sound, when separated from his
earthly covering.</p>

<p>The causes of spirits appearing after death were generally
three. Murdered persons came again to haunt their murderers,
or to obtain justice by appearing to other persons likely to see
them avenged. Persons who had hid any treasure, were
doomed to haunt the place where that treasure was hid; as
they had made a god of their wealth in this world, the place
where their treasure lay was to be their heaven after death.
If any person could speak to them, and give them an opportunity
of confessing where their treasure was hid, they could
then rest in peace, but not otherwise. Those who died with
any heavy crimes on their consciences, which they had not
confessed, were also doomed to wander on the earth at the
midnight hour.</p>

<p>Spirits had no power over those who did not molest them;
but if insulted, they seem to have been extremely vindictive,
and to have felt little compunction in killing the insulter.
They had power to assume any form, and to change it as
often as they pleased; but they could neither vanish nor
change, while a human eye was fixed upon them.</p>

<p>Midway on Windermere, below the range of islands which
intersect the lake, extends the track along which ply the Ferry
boats between the little inn on the western side and the
wooded promontory on the opposite shore. The Ferry
House, with its lawn in front and few branching sycamores,
occupies a jutting area between the base of a perpendicular
cliff and the lake. Few finer prospects can be desired than
that afforded from the summit which overhangs the Mere at
this point. The summer house, which has been built for the
sake of the views it commands of the surrounding country, is
a favourite resort of lovers of the beautiful in nature, whence
they may witness, in its many aspects afar, the grandeur of the
mountain world; and near and below, the beauty of the
curving shores and wooded isles of this queen of English
lakes. From the Ferry House to the Ferry Nab, as the
promontory is called, on the western shore, is barely half a
mile. It was from thence that in the dark stormy night the
Evil voice cried "Boat!" which the poor ferryman obeyed so
fatally. No passenger was there, but a sight which sent him
back with bloodless face and dumb, to die on the morrow.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE CUCKOO IN BORRODALE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Far within those rocky regions<br />
Where old Scawfell's hoary legions,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Robed and capped with storms and snow,</span><br />
Here like rugged Vikings towering,<br />
There like giants grimly cowering,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look into the vales below;</span><br />
<br />
Once where Borrhy wild and fearless,<br />
Once where Oller brave and peerless,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hew'd the forest, cleared the vale,</span><br />
Gave their names to cling for ever<br />
Round thy dells by crag and river,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dark and wintry Borrodale!</span><br />
<br />
In that dreariest of the valleys,<br />
Strifes for evermore, and malice<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without end the dalesmen vexed.</span><br />
Neighbour had no heart for neighbour.<br />
Never side by side to labour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Went or came they unperplex'd.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><br />
Cheerless were the fields and houses.<br />
Gloomily the sullen spouses<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moved about the hearths and floors.</span><br />
Sunshine was an alms from Heaven<br />
That not one day out of seven<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God's bright beams brought to their doors.</span><br />
<br />
And 'mid discontent and anguish<br />
Every virtue seem'd to languish;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every soul groan'd with its load.</span><br />
Lingering in his walks beside them,<br />
Oft their friendly Pastor eyed them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his heart with pity glow'd.</span><br />
<br />
"Ah!" he thought, "that looks of kindness<br />
Could but enter here! the blindness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of this life, could it but seem</span><br />
To them the death it is!&mdash;but listen!"&mdash;<br />
And his eyes began to glisten:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spring was round him like a dream.</span><br />
<br />
"'Tis the Cuckoo!"&mdash;In the hollow<br />
Up the valley seem'd to follow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spring's fair footsteps that sweet throat.</span><br />
All the fields put off their sadness;<br />
Trees and hills and skies with gladness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Answering to the Cuckoo's note.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><br />
Then on that still Sabbath-morrow,<br />
Spake the Pastor&mdash;"Let us borrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Gladness from this new-born Spring.</span><br />
Hark, the bird that brings the blossoms!<br />
Brings the sunshine to our bosoms!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Makes with joy the valleys ring!</span><br />
<br />
"Coming from afar to cheer us,<br />
Could we always keep him near us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All these heavenly skies from far,</span><br />
All this blessed morn discovers,<br />
All this Spring that round us hovers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would be still what now they are!</span><br />
<br />
"Let us all go forth and labour,<br />
Sire, and son, and wife, and neighbour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">First the bread, the life, to win:</span><br />
Then by yonder stream we'll rally,<br />
Build a wall across the valley,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we'll close the Cuckoo in.</span><br />
<br />
"So this Spring time, never failing,<br />
While it hears his music hailing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the wood and by the rill.</span><br />
Shall, its new born life retaining,<br />
Till our mortal hours are waning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Warm and light and cheer us still."&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><br />
Flush'd the morn; and all were ready.<br />
Sowers sowed with paces steady;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plough'd the ploughers in the field;</span><br />
Delved the gardeners; planters planted;<br />
Then to their great work, undaunted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Forth they fared their wall to build.</span><br />
<br />
Stone by stone, the wall beside them<br />
Rose. Their Pastor came to guide them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Day by day, and spake to cheer;</span><br />
While each labouring hand the others<br />
Helped, and one and all like brothers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wrought along the ripening year.</span><br />
<br />
Then they gathered in their houses,<br />
Men and maidens, sires and spouses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Talking of their wall. And when</span><br />
Soon the long bright day returning<br />
Called them, every heart was yearning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To resume its task again.</span><br />
<br />
And on every eve they parted<br />
At their thresholds, kindlier-hearted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looking forth again to meet.</span><br />
All had something good or gladdening<br />
On their lips; the only saddening<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sounds were those of parting feet.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><br />
So their wall, extending ever,<br />
Spann'd at length the vale and river;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grasp'd the mountains there and here:</span><br />
Reached towards the blue of heaven;<br />
Touched the light cloud o'er it driven;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the end at length was near.</span><br />
<br />
June had come; and all was vernal:<br />
Seemed secure their Spring eternal:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Eyes were bright, and skies were blue:</span><br />
When&mdash;at Nature's call&mdash;unguided&mdash;<br />
Out the voice above them glided,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Cuckoo!"&mdash;far away, "Cuckoo!"</span><br />
<br />
"Gone!" a hundred tongues in chorus<br />
Shouted; "Gone! the bird that bore us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spring with all things bright and good!"</span><br />
While, in stupor and amazement,<br />
Vacantly from cope to basement<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glowering at their wall, they stood.&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
But though all forgot, while building<br />
Up their wall, that months were yielding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each in turn to others' sway,</span><br />
With their leaves and landscapes changing;<br />
And, to skies more constant ranging,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fled the Cuckoo far away!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><br />
Winter from their hearts had perished;<br />
Spring in every heart was cherished;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Every charm of life and love&mdash;</span><br />
Love for wife and home and neighbour&mdash;<br />
Sprang from out that genial labour;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Peace around, and Heaven above.</span><br />
<br />
Faith into their lives had entered;<br />
Joy and fellowship were centred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wheresoe'er a hearth was found.</span><br />
While the calm bright hope before them<br />
Temper'd even the rains, and o'er them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charmed to rest the tempests' sound.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE CUCKOO IN BORRODALE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>If the traditions of the past, and the estimate formed of
them by their distant neighbours, bear rather hardly upon the
people of Borrodale, it must be remembered that the relations
of that dale to the world without were very different a hundred
years ago from what they are now. It was a recess, approached
by a long and winding valley, from the vale of Keswick, with
the lake extending between its entrance and the town. The
highest mountains of the district closed round its head. Its
entrance was guarded by a woody hill, on which had formerly
stood a Roman fortress, afterwards occupied by the Saxons,
and which in later times was maintained in its military capacity
by the monks of Furness. For here one of their principal
magazines was established, and the holy fathers had great
possessions to defend from the frequent irruptions of the Scots
in those days. Besides their tithe corn, they amassed here
the valuable minerals of the country; among which salt,
produced from a spring in the valley, was no inconsiderable
article.</p>

<p>In this deep retreat the inhabitants of the villages of Rosthwaite
and Seathwaite, having at all times little intercourse
with the country, during half the year were almost totally
excluded from all human commerce. The surrounding hills
attract the vapours, and rain falls abundantly; snow lies long
in the valleys; and the clouds frequently obscure the sky.
Upon the latter village, in the depth of winter, the sun never
shines. As the spring advances, his rays begin to shoot over
the southern mountains; and at high noon to tip the chimney
tops with their light. That radiant sign shows the cheerless
winter to be now over; and rouses the hardy peasants to the
labours of the coming year. Their scanty patches of arable
land they cultivated with difficulty; and their crops late in
ripening, and often a prey to autumnal rains, which are violent
in this country, just gave them bread to eat. Their herds
afforded them milk; and their flocks supplied them with
clothes: the shepherd himself being often the manufacturer
also. No dye was necessary to tinge their wool: it was
naturally a russet brown; and sheep and shepherds were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>clothed alike, both in the simple livery of nature. The
procuring of fuel was among their greatest hardships. Here
the inhabitants were obliged to get on the tops of the mountains;
which abounding with mossy grounds, seldom found
in the valleys below, supplied them with peat. This, made
into bundles, and fastened upon sledges, they guided down
the precipitous sides of the mountains, and stored in their
outbuildings. At the period to which we refer, a hundred
years ago, the roads were of the rudest construction, scarcely
passable even for horses. A cart or any kind of wheeled
carriage was totally unknown in Borrodale. They carried
their hay home upon their horses, in bundles, one on each
side: they made no stacks. Their manure they carried in the
same manner, as also the smaller wood for firing: the larger
logs they trailed. Their food in summer consisted of fish and
small mutton; in winter, of bacon and hung mutton. Nor
was their method of drying their mutton less rude: they hung
the sheep up by the hinder legs, and took away only the head
and entrails. In this situation, I myself, says Clarke, have
seen seven sheep hanging in one chimney.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Borrodale were a proverb, even among
their unpolished neighbours, for ignorance; and a thousand
absurd and improbable stories are related of their stupidity;
such as mistaking a red-deer, seen upon one of their mountains,
for a horned horse; at the sight of which they assembled
in considerable numbers, and provided themselves with ropes,
thinking to take him by the same means as they did their
horses when wild in the field, by running them into a strait,
and then tripping them up with a cord. A chase of several
hours proved fruitless; when they returned thoroughly convinced
they had been chasing a witch. Such like is the story
of the mule, which, being ridden into the dale by a stranger
bound for the mountains, was left in the care of his host at the
foot of a pass. The neighbours assembled to see the curious
animal, and consulted the wise man of the dale as to what
it could be. With his book, and his thoughts in serious
deliberation, he was enabled to announce authoritatively that
the brute was a peacock! So when a new light broke into
Borrodale, and lime was first sent for from beyond Keswick;
the carrier was an old dalesman with horse and sacks. Rain
falling, it began to smoke: some water from the river was
procured by him to extinguish the unnatural fire; but the evil
was increased, and the smoke grew worse. Assured at length
that he had got the devil in his sacks, as he must be in any
fire which was aggravated by water, he tossed the whole load
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>over into the river. The tale of the stirrups is perhaps a little
too absurd even for Borrodale. A "'statesman" brought home
from a distant fair or sale, what had never before been seen in
the dale, a pair of stirrups. Riding home in them, when he
reached his own door, his feet had become so fastened in
them, that they could not be got out; so as there was no
help for it, he patiently sat his horse in the pasture for a day
or two, his family bringing him food, then it was proposed
to bring them both into the stable, which was done; his
family bringing him food as before. At length it occurred to
some one that he might be lifted with the saddle from the
horse, and carried thereupon into the house. There the
mounted man sat spinning wool in a corner of the kitchen,
till the return of one of his sons from St. Bees school, whose
learning, after due consideration of the case, suggested that
the good man should draw his feet out of his shoes: when to
the joy of his family he was restored to his occupation and to
liberty. But the story of the Cuckoo has made its local name
the "Gowk" synonymous with an inhabitant of the vale. There
the Spring was very charming, and the voice of the bird rare
and gladsome. It occurred to the natives that a wall built
across the entrance of their valley, at Grange, if made high
enough, would keep the cuckoo among them, and make the
cheerful Spring-days last for ever. The plan was tried, and
failed only because, according to popular belief from generation
to generation, the wall was not built one course higher.</p>

<p>The wetness of the weather in Borrodale is something more
than an occasional inconvenience. It may be judged of by
observations which show the following results. The average
quantity of rain in many parts of the south of England does
not exceed 20 inches, and sometimes does not even reach that
amount. The mean rain fall for England is 30 inches.
Kendal and Keswick have been considered the wettest places
known in England; and the annual average at the former
place is 52 inches. It was found by experiments made in
1852, that while 81 inches were measured on Scawfell Pike;
86 at Great Gable; 124 at Sty Head; 156 were measured at
Seathwaite in Borrodale; shewing, with the exception of that
at Sprinkling Tarn, between Scawfell, and Langdale Pikes,
and Great Gable, where it measured 168 inches nearly, the
greatest rainfall in the Lake District to be at the head of
Borrodale. Taking a period of ten years, the average annual
rainfall at Seathwaite in that dale was over 126 inches; for
the rest of England it was 29 inches.</p></blockquote>

<h2>KING EVELING.</h2>

<div class="poem">
King Eveling stood by the Azure River,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the tide-wave landward began to flow;</span><br />
And over the sea in the sunlight's shiver,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He watch'd one white sail northward go.</span><br />
<br />
"Twice has it pass'd; and I linger, weary:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How I long for its coming, my life to close!</span><br />
My lands forget me, my halls are dreary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my age is lonely; I want repose.</span><br />
<br />
"If rightly I read the signs within me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tides may lessen, the moon may wane,</span><br />
And then the Powers I have serv'd will win me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A pathway over yon shining plain.</span><br />
<br />
"It befits a King, who has wisely spoken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose rule was just, and whose deeds were brave,</span><br />
To depart alone, and to leave no token<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On earth but of glory&mdash;not even a grave.</span><br />
<br />
"And now I am going. No more to know me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My banners fall round me with age outworn.</span><br />
I have buried my crown in the sands below me;<br />

<br />
For days the tides with ebbing and flowing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grew full with the moon; and out of the dim,</span><br />
On the ocean's verge came the white sail growing,<br />

<br />
His people slept. For to them descended,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that good time of the King, their rest,</span><br />
While the lengthening shades of the eve yet blended<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the golden sunbeams low in the west.</span><br />
<br />
No banded host on his footsteps waited,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No child nor vassal from bower or hall:</span><br />
He look'd around him like one belated<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On a lonely wild; and he went from all.</span><br />
<br />
Slowly he strode to the ship; and for ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sailed out from the land he had ruled so well;</span><br />
And the name of the King by the Azure River<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "KING EVELING."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The ancient, but now insignificant town and seaport of
Ravenglass, six miles from Bootle and about sixteen from
Whitehaven, is situated on a small creek, at the confluence
of the rivers Esk, Mite, and Irt, which form a large sandy
harbour. Of this place the Editor of Camden, Bishop Gibson,
says&mdash;"The shore, wheeling to the north, comes to Ravenglass,
a harbour for ships, and commodiously surrounded with
two rivers; where, as I am told, there have been found Roman
inscriptions. Some will have it to have been formerly called
Aven-glass, i.e. (C&oelig;ruleus) an azure sky-coloured river; and
tell you abundance of stories about King Eveling, who had
his palace here."</p>

<p>Ravenglass appears from Mr. Sandford's M.S. to have been
of old of some importance as a fishing town. He says&mdash;"Here
were some salmons and all sorts of fish in plenty; but the
greatest plenty of herrings, (it) is a daintye fish of a foot long;
and so plenteous a fishing thereof and in the sea betwixt and
the ile of man, as they lie in sholes together so thike in the
sea at spawning, about August, <i>as a ship cannot pass thorow</i>:
and the fishers go from all the coast to catch them."</p>

<p>There was also formerly a considerable pearl-fishery at this
place: and Camden speaks of the shell-fish in the Irt producing
pearls. Sir John Hawkins obtained from government
the right of fishing for pearls in that river. The pearls were
obtained from mussels, by the inhabitants of the neighbourhood,
who sought for them at low water, and afterwards sold them
to the jewellers. About the year 1695, a patent was granted
to some gentlemen, for pearl-fishing in the Irt; but how the
undertaking prospered is uncertain. The pearl-mussels do not
appear to have been very plentiful for many years. Nicolson
and Burn observe, that Mr. Thomas Patrickson, of How in
this County, is said to have obtained as many from divers
poor people, whom he employed to gather them, as he
afterwards sold in London for £800.</p>

<p>Tacitus in the "Agricola" describes the pearls found in
Britain as being of a dark and livid hue. Pliny also:&mdash;"In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Britain some pearls do grow, but they are small and dim, not
clear and bright." And again:&mdash;"Julius Cæsar did not deny,
that the breast-plate which he dedicated to Venus Genitrix,
within the temple, was made of British pearls." So that it is
not at all improbable that our little northern stream even may
have contributed in some degree to the splendour of the
imperial offering.</p>

<p>The manor in which Ravenglass is included is dependent
on the barony of Egremont; and King John granted to
Richard Lucy, as lord paramount, a yearly fair to be held
here on St. James's day, and a weekly market every Saturday;
and at the present time the successor to the Earls of Egremont,
Lord Leconfield, holds the fair of Ravenglass, on the eve,
day, and morrow of St. James. Hutchinson thus describes
it:&mdash;"There are singular circumstances and ceremonies
attending the proclamation of this fair, as being anciently
held under the maintenance and protection of the Castle of
Egremont. On the first day, the lord's steward is attended
by the sargeant of the Borough of Egremont, with the insignia
(called the bow of Egremont), the foresters, with their bows
and horns, and all the tenants of the forest of Copeland,
whose special service is to attend the lord and his representative
at Ravenglass fair, and abide there during its
continuance; anciently, for the protection of a free-trade, and
to defend the merchandise against free-booters, and a foreign
enemy: such was the wretched state of this country in former
times, that all such protection was scarce sufficient. For the
maintenance of the horses of those who attend the ceremony,
they have by custom, a portion of land assigned in the meadow,
called, or distinguished, by the name of two Swaiths of grass
in the common field of Ravenglass. On the third day at noon,
the earl's officers, and tenants of the forest depart, after proclamation;
and Lord Muncaster (as mesne lord) and his tenants
take a formal repossession of the place; and the day is
concluded with horse races and rural diversions."</p>

<p>A genuine specimen of feudal observances is preserved in
the custom of riding the boundaries of manors, which, in the
mountain district, where the line of division is not very
distinct, is performed perhaps once during each generation,
by the representatives of the lord of the manor, accompanied
by an immense straggling procession of all ages,&mdash;the old men
being made useful in pointing out important or disputed
portions of the boundary, and the young in having it impressed
on their memories, so that their evidence or recollection may
be made available in future peregrinations. In older times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>when the interests of the lords outweighed farther than in our
own day the rights of the peasantry, certain youthful members
of the retinue, in order to deepen the impression and make it
more enduring, were severely whipped at all those points
which the stewards were most anxious to have held in
remembrance. The occasions always wind up with a banquet,
provided on a most liberal scale by the lord of the manor, and
open to all who take part in the business of the day.</p>

<p>Another local usage connected with the landed interest, and
long observed with notable regularity, was the following.
When salmon was plentiful in the Cumberland rivers, and
formed a very important element in the ordinary living of the
occupants of adjoining lands, the tenants of the manor of
Ennerdale and Kinniside claimed "a free stream" in the river
Ehen, from Ennerdale lake to the sea, and assembled once a
year to "ride the stream." If obstructions were found, such
as weirs and dams, they were at once destroyed. Refreshments
were levied or provided at certain places on the river for the
cavalcade. This custom has long ceased to be observed.</p>

<p>About a quarter of a mile to the south east of this place is
an old ivy-mantled ruin, designated Wall Castle. It is said
to have been the original residence of the Penningtons, but in
all probability it dates from a much remoter period. Stone
battle-axes and arrow-heads have been found around it, and
coins of different people, principally Roman and Saxon. The
building is strongly cemented with run lime.</p>

<p>This old castle stands at no great distance from the second
cutting through which the railroad passes after leaving Ravenglass:
adjoining to which, a little below the surface of the
ground, an ancient fosse and several foundations of walls have
been laid bare by the owner of the estate, and large quantities
of building stone removed from them at various times. In
making this cutting, the workmen laid open an ancient burial
place, which was of great depth, and contained a quantity of
human remains, with several bones of animals. The sides
were secured by strong timber and stone work. The buried
bodies were very numerous, and the place was evidently
of very great antiquity. From the presence of oak leaves and
acorns, charred wood, etc., it has been supposed to have been
the tomb of the victims in some Druidical sacrifice: it being
known that the Druids immolated their criminals, by placing
them collectively in the interior of a large image of wickerwork,
and then setting fire to it; and that various animals
were sacrificed along with them by way of expiation.</p>

<p>About five miles to the east of Ravenglass is the small lake
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>of Devoke Water, near the foot of which, on the summit of a
considerable hill, stand the ruins of another interesting piece
of antiquity, the so-called city of Barnscar or Bardscar. Its
site is so elevated, as to command a wide extent of country,
and an ancient road from Ulpha to Ravenglass passes through
it. The name is purely Scandinavian, and tradition ascribes
it to the Danes. A well known popular saying in the locality
refers to the manner in which this city is said to have been
peopled by its founders, who gathered for inhabitants the men
of Drigg and the women of Beckermet. The original helpmates
of the latter place are supposed to have fallen in battle:
what had become of the wives and daughters of the former
place is not averred. But the saying continues&mdash;"Let us gang
togidder like t' lads o' Drigg, an' t' lasses o' Beckermet."</p>

<p>The description of this place given by Hutchinson at the
latter end of last century is as follows:&mdash;"This place is about
300 yards long, from east to west; and 100 yards broad, from
north to south; now walled round, save at the east end, near
three feet in height; there appears to have been a long street,
with several cross ones: the remains of housesteads, within
the walls, are not very numerous, but on the outside of the
walls they are innumerable, especially on the south side and
west end; the circumference of the city and suburbs is near
three computed miles; the figure an oblong square." It is
added that about the year 1730, a considerable quantity of
silver coin was found in the ruins of one of the houses,
concealed in a cavity, formed in a beam; none of which unfortunately
has been preserved, to throw light upon the name,
the race, or character and habits of its possessors.</p>

<p>From the Pow to the Duddon innumerable objects of
interest lie scattered between the mountains and the sea coast,
of which little more can be said than was stated, as above, by
Camden's editor&mdash;"Some tell you abundance of stories about
them"&mdash;as well as "about King Eveling, who had his palace
here."</p></blockquote>

<h2>SIR LANCELOT THRELKELD.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The widows were sitting in Threlkeld Hall;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The corn stood green on Midsummer-day;</span><br />
Their little grand-children were tossing the ball;<br />
And the farmers leaned over the garden wall;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the widows were spinning the eve away.</span><br />
<br />
They busily talk'd of the days long gone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on Midsummer-day;</span><br />
How old Sir Lancelot's armour had shone<br />
On the panels of oak by the broad hearthstone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the widows sat spinning that eve away.</span><br />
<br />
For, Threlkeld Hall of his mansions three&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the corn stood green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
Was his noblest house; and a stately tree<br />
Was the good old Knight, and of high degree;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a braver rode never in battle array.</span><br />
<br />
Now peaceful farmers think of their corn&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The corn so green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
Where once, at the blast of Sir Lancelot's horn,<br />
His horsemen all mustered, his banner was borne;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he went like a Chief in his pride to the fray.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><br />
And there the good Clifford, the Shepherd-Lord,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the corn stood green on Midsummer-day,</span><br />
Sat, humbly clad, at Sir Lancelot's board;<br />
And tended the flocks, while rusted his sword<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the hall where the widows were spinning away;</span><br />
<br />
Till the new King called him back to his own&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the corn stood green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
To his honours and name of high renown;<br />
When Sir Lancelot old and feeble had grown;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From his rude shepherd-life called Lord Clifford away.</span><br />
<br />
And sad was that morrow in Threlkeld Hall&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the corn was green on that Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
When the Clifford stood ready to part from all;<br />
And his shepherd's staff was hung up on the wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that room where the widows sat spinning away.</span><br />
<br />
And Sir Lancelot mounted, and called his men&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
And he gazed on Lord Clifford again and again;<br />
And Sir Lancelot rode with him over the plain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And at length with strong effort his silence gave way.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><br />
"I am old," Sir Lancelot said; "and I know&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the corn stands green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
There will wars arise, and I shall be low,<br />
Who ever was ready to arm and go!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For he loved the war tramp and the martial array.</span><br />
<br />
"If ever a Knight might revisit this earth&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stands green on Midsummer-day"&mdash;</span><br />
Said the Clifford&mdash;"When troubles and wars have birth,<br />
Thou never shalt fail from Threlkeld's hearth!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From that hearth where the widows were spinning away.</span><br />
<br />
And so, along Souther Fell-side they press'd&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on Midsummer-day,&mdash;</span><br />
And then they parted&mdash;to east and to west&mdash;<br />
And Sir Lancelot came and was laid to his rest.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the widows there spinning the eve away.</span><br />
<br />
And the Shepherd had power in unwritten lore:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The corn stands green on Midsummer-day:</span><br />
And although the Knight's coffin his banner hangs o'er,<br />
Sir Lancelot yet can tread this floor;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the widows there spinning the eve away.&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><br />
Thus gossip'd the widows in Threlkeld Hall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on Midsummer-day:</span><br />
When the sound of a footstep was heard to fall,<br />
And an arm'd shadow pass'd over the wall&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a Knight with his plume and in martial array.</span><br />
<br />
With a growl the fierce dogs slunk behind the huge chair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on that Midsummer-day;</span><br />
And the widows stopt spinning; and each was aware<br />
Of a tread to the porch, and Sir Lancelot there&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And a stir as of horsemen all riding away.</span><br />
<br />
They turned their dim eyes to the lattice to gaze&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
But before their old limbs they could feebly raise,<br />
The horsemen and horses were far on the ways&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the Hall, where the widows were spinning away.</span><br />
<br />
And far along Souter Fell-side they strode,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on that Midsummer-day.</span><br />
And the brave old Knight on his charger rode,<br />
As he wont to ride from his old abode,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his sword by his side and in martial array.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span><br />
Like a chief he galloped before and behind&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
To the marshalled ranks he waved, and signed;<br />
And his banner streamed out on the evening wind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they rode along Souter Fell-side away.</span><br />
<br />
And to many an eye was revealed the sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stood green that Midsummer-day;</span><br />
As Sir Lancelot Threlkeld the ancient Knight<br />
With all his horsemen went over the height:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the steep mountain summit went riding away.</span><br />
<br />
And then as the twilight closed over the dell&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the corn stood green that Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
Came the farmers and peasants all flocking to tell<br />
How Sir Lancelot's troop had gone over the fell!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the widows sat listening, and spinning away.</span><br />
<br />
And the widows looked mournfully round the old hall;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the corn stood green on Midsummer-day;</span><br />
"He is come at the good Lord Clifford's call!<br />
He is up for the King, with his warriors all!"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the widows there spinning the eve away.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><br />
"There is evil to happen, and war is at hand&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where the corn stands green this Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
Or rebels are plotting to waste the land;<br />
Or he never would come with his armed band"&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the widows there spinning the eve away.</span><br />
<br />
"Our old men sleep in the grave. They cease:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While the corn stands green on Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
They rest, though troubles on earth increase;<br />
And soon may Sir Lancelot's soul have peace!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sighed the widows while spinning the eve away.</span><br />
<br />
"But this was the Promise the Shepherd-Lord&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the corn stood green that Midsummer-day&mdash;</span><br />
Gave, parting from Threlkeld's hearth and board,<br />
To the brave old Knight&mdash;and he keeps his word!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said the widows all putting their spinning away.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "SIR LANCELOT THRELKELD."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The little village of Threlkeld is situated at the foot of
Blencathra about four miles from Keswick, on the highroad
from that town to Penrith. The old hall has long been in a state
of dilapidation, the only habitable part having been for years
converted into a farm house. Some faint traces of the moat
are said to be yet discernible. This was one of the residences
of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, a powerful knight in the reign of
Henry the Seventh, step-father to the Shepherd Lord. His
son, the last Sir Lancelot, was wont to say that he had "three
noble houses&mdash;one for pleasure, Crosby in Westmorland, where
he had a park full of deer; one for profit and warmth, wherein
to reside during winter, namely, Yanwath, near Penrith; and
the third, Threlkeld, on the edge of the vale of Keswick, well
stocked with tenants to go with him to the wars." Sir Lancelot
is said to have been a man of a kind and generous disposition,
who had either taken the side of the White Rose in the great
national quarrel, or at least had not compromised himself to
a ruinous extent on the other side; and has long had the
reputation of having afforded a retreat to the Shepherd Lord
Clifford, on the utter ruin of his house, after the crushing of
the Red Rose at Towton, when the Baron (his late father)
was attained in parliament, and all his lands were seized by
the crown.</p>

<p>The Cliffords, Lords of Westmorland, afterwards Earls of
Cumberland, were a family of great power and princely
possessions, who for many generations occupied a position in
the North West of England, similar to that held by the Percies,
Earls of Northumberland, in the north-east.</p>

<p>Their blood was perhaps the most illustrious in the land.
Descended from Rollo first Duke of Normandy, by alliances
in marriage it intermingled with that of William the Lion,
King of Scotland, and with that of several of the Sovereigns
of England.</p>

<p>Their territorial possessions corresponded with their illustrious
birth. These comprised their most ancient stronghold, Clifford
Castle, on the Wye, in Herefordshire; the lordship of the
barony of Westmorland, including the seigniories and Castles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>of Brougham and Appleby; Skipton Castle in the West
Riding of Yorkshire, with its numerous townships, and important
forest and manorial rights, their most princely, and
apparently favourite residence; and the Hall and estates of
Lonsborrow in the same County.</p>

<p>The Cliffords are said to be sprung from an uncle of William
the Conqueror. The father of William had a younger brother,
whose third son, Richard Fitz-Pontz, married the daughter
and heiress of Ralph de Toni, of Clifford Castle, in Herefordshire.
Their second son, Walter, succeeding to his mother's
estates, assumed the name of Clifford, and was the father of
the Fair Rosamond, the famous mistress of King Henry the
Second. He died in 1176. His great-grandson, Roger de
Clifford acquired the inheritance of the Veteriponts or Viponts,
Lords of Brougham Castle in Westmorland, by his marriage
with one of the co-heiresses of Robert de Vipont, the last of that
race. It was their son Robert who was first summoned to sit
in parliament, by a writ dated the 29th of December, 1299, as
the Lord Clifford.</p>

<p>The Cliffords were a warlike race, and engaged in all the
contests of the time. For many generations the chiefs of their
house figure as distinguished soldiers and captains; and most
of them died on the field of battle.</p>

<p>Roger, the father of the first lord, was renowned in the
wars of Henry III. and of Edward I., and was killed in a
skirmish with the Welsh in the Isle of Anglesey, on St.
Leonard's day, 1283.</p>

<p>His son Robert, the first Lord Clifford, a favourite and
companion in arms of Edward I., was one of the guardians of
Edward II. when a minor, and Lord High Admiral in that
monarch's reign. He fell at the battle of Bannockburn,
in 1314.</p>

<p>Roger, his son, the second lord, was engaged in the Earl
of Lancaster's insurrection, and had done much to deserve
political martyrdom in that rebellious age: but a feeling of
humanity, such as is seldom read of in civil wars, and especially
in those times, saved him from execution, when he was taken
prisoner with Lancaster and the rest of his associates. He
had received so many wounds in the battle (of Borough bridge),
that he could not be brought before the judge for the summary
trial, which would have sent him to the hurdle and the
gallows. Being looked upon, therefore, as a dying man, he
was respited from the course of law: time enough elapsed,
while he continued in this state, for the heat of resentment to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>abate, and Edward of Carnarvon, who, though a weak and
most misguided prince, was not a cruel one, spared his life;
an act of mercy which was the more graceful, because Clifford
had insulted the royal authority in a manner less likely to be
forgiven than his braving it in arms. A pursuivant had served
a writ upon him in the Barons' Chamber, and he made the
man eat the wax wherewith the writ was signed, "in contempt,
as it were, of the said King."</p>

<p>He was the first Lord Clifford that was attainted of treason.
His lands and honours were restored in the first year of
Edward III., but he survived the restoration only a few weeks,
dying in the flower of his age, unmarried; but leaving "some
base children behind him, whom he had by a mean woman
who was called Julian of the Bower, for whom he built a little
house hard by Whinfell, and called it Julian's Bower, the
lower foundation of which standeth, and is yet to be seen,"
said the compiler of the family records, an hundred and fifty
years ago, "though all the walls be down long since. And it
is thought that the love which this Roger bore to this Julian
kept him from marrying any other woman."</p>

<p>Roger de Clifford was succeeded in his titles and estates by
his brother Robert, the third baron, who married Isabella de
Berkeley, sister to Thomas, Lord Berkeley, of Berkeley
Castle; in which Castle, two years after it had rung with
"shrieks of death," when the tragedy of Edward II. was
brought to its dreadful catastrophe there, the marriage was
performed.</p>

<p>This Robert lived a country life, and "nothing is mentioned
of him in the wars," except that he once accompanied an army
into Scotland. It is, however, related of him, that when
Edward Baliol was driven from Scotland, the exiled king was
"right honourably received by him in Westmorland, and
entertained in his Castles of Brougham, Appleby, and Pendragon;"
in acknowledgement for which hospitality Baliol,
if he might at any time recover the kingdom of Scotland out
of his adversaries' hands, made him a grant of Douglas Dale,
which had been granted to his grandfather who fell in Wales.
The Hart's Horn Tree in Whinfell Park, well known in
tradition, and in hunters' tales, owes its celebrity to this visit.
He died in 1340.</p>

<p>Robert, his son, fourth lord, fought by the side of Edward
the Black Prince at the memorable battles of Cressy and
Poictiers.</p>

<p>Roger, his brother, the fifth lord, styled "one of the wisest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>and gallantest of the Cliffords," also served in the wars in
France and Scotland, in the reign of Edward III.</p>

<p>Thomas, his son, sixth lord Clifford, one of the most
chivalrous knights of his time, overcame, in a memorable
passage of arms, the famous French knight, "le Sire de
Burjisande," and, at the age of thirty, was killed in the battle
at Spruce in Germany.</p>

<p>John, his son, the seventh lord, a Knight of the Garter,
carried with him to the French wars three knights, forty-seven
esquires, and one hundred and fifty archers. He fought under
the banner of Henry V. at the battle of Agincourt, attended
him at the sieges Harfleur and Cherbourg, and was eventually
slain, at the age of thirty-three, at the siege of Meaux in
France.</p>

<p>Thomas, his son, eighth lord Clifford, described as "a chief
commander in France," was grandson on his mother's side to the
celebrated Hotspur, Harry Percy, and gained renown by the
daring and ingenious stratagem which he planned and successfully
executed for taking the town of Pontoise, near Paris, in
1438. The English had lain for some time before the town,
with little prospect of reducing it, when a heavy fall of snow
suggested to Lord Clifford the means of effecting its capture.
Arraying himself and his followers with white tunics over
their armour, he concealed them during the night close to the
walls of the town, which at daybreak he surprised and carried
by storm. Two years afterwards he valiantly defended the
town of Pontoise against the armies of France, headed by
Charles VII. in person.</p>

<p>In the Wars of the Roses they were not less prominent.
The last mentioned Thomas, though nearly allied by blood to
the house of York, took part with his unfortunate sovereign,
Henry VI., and fell on the 22nd of May, 1455, at the first
battle of St. Albans, receiving his death-blow from the hands
of Richard Duke of York, at the age of forty.</p>

<p>John, his son, the next and ninth lord, called from his
complexion the Black-faced Clifford, thirsting to revenge the
fate of his father, perpetrated that memorable act of cruelty,
which for centuries has excited indignation and tears, the
murder of the young Earl of Rutland, brother of Edward IV.,
in the pursuit after the battle of Wakefield, on the 30th
December, 1460. The latter, whilst being withdrawn from
the field by his attendant chaplain and schoolmaster, a priest,
called Sir Robert Aspall, was espied by Lord Clifford; and
being recognised by means of his apparel, "dismayed, had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>not a word to speak, but kneeled on his knees imploring
mercy and desiring grace, both with holding up his hands and
making dolorous countenance, for his speech was gone for
fear. 'Save him,' said his chaplain, 'for he is a prince's son,
and peradventure may do you good hereafter.' With that
word, the Lord Clifford marked him and said, 'By God's
blood, thy father slew mine, and so will I do thee and all thy
kin;' and with that word stuck the earl to the heart with his
dagger, and bade his chaplain bear the earl's mother and
brother word what he had done and said."</p>

<p>The murder in cold blood of this unarmed boy, for he was
only twelve or at most seventeen years old, while supplicating
for his life, was not the only atrocity committed by Lord
Clifford on that eventful day. "This cruel Clifford and
deadly blood-supper," writes the old chronicler, "not content
with this homicide or child-killing, came to the place where
the dead corpse of the Duke of York lay, and caused his head
to be stricken off, and set on it a crown of paper, and so fixed
it on a pole and presented it to the queen, not lying far from
the field, in great spite and much derision, saying, 'Madam,
your war is done; here is your king's ransom;' at which
present was much joy and great rejoicing."</p>

<p>Lord Clifford fought at the second battle of St. Albans, on
the 17th of February, 1461. It was in his tent, after the
Lancastrians had won the victory, that the unfortunate
Henry VI. once more embraced his consort Margaret of
Anjou, and their beloved child.</p>

<p>Lord Clifford is usually represented as having been slain at
the battle of Towton. He fell, however, in a hard fought
conflict which preceded that engagement by a few hours, at a
spot called Dittingale, situated in a small valley between
Towton and Scarthingwell, struck in the throat by a headless
arrow, discharged from behind a hedge.</p>

<p>A small chapel on the banks of the Aire formerly marked
the spot where lay the remains of John Lord Clifford, as well
as those of his cousin, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland,
who perished later in the day upon Towton Field, on the 29th
of March, 1461.</p>

<p>For nearly a quarter of a century from this time, the name
of Clifford remained an attainted one; their castles and
seigniories passed into the hands of strangers and enemies.
The barony of Westmorland was conferred by Edward IV.
upon his brother Richard Duke of Gloucester; the castle and
manor of Skipton he bestowed, in the first instance, upon Sir
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>William Stanley; but in the fifteenth year of his reign he
transferred them to his "dear brother," which lordly appanage
he retained till his death on Bosworth Field.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>The young widow left by the Black-faced Clifford, was
Margaret daughter and sole heiress of Henry de Bromflete,
Baron de Vesci. She had borne her husband three children,
two sons and a daughter, now attainted by parliament,
deprived of their honours and inheritance, and their persons
and lives in hourly jeopardy from the strict search which was
being made for them. The seat of her father at Lonsborrow
in Yorkshire, surrounded by a wild district, offered a retreat
from their enemies; and thither, as soon as the fate of her
lord was communicated to her, driven from the stately halls
of Skipton and Appleby, of which she had ceased to be
mistress, flew the young widow with her hunted children, and
saved them from the rage of the victorious party by concealment.</p>

<p>Henry, the elder son, at the period of their flight to
Lonsborrow was only seven years old. He was there placed
by his mother, in the neighbourhood where she lived, with a
shepherd who had married one of her inferior servants, an
attendant on his nurse, to be brought up in no better condition
than the shepherd's own children. The strict inquiry which
had been made after them, and the subsequent examination
of their mother respecting them, at length led to the conclusion
that they had been conveyed beyond the sea, whither in
truth the younger boy had been sent, into the Netherlands,
and not long after died there. The daughter grew up to
womanhood, and became the wife of Sir Robert Aske, from
whom descended the Askes of Yorkshire, and the Lord
Fairfax of Denton in the same county.</p>

<p>When the high born shepherd boy was about his fourteenth
year, his grandfather, Lord de Vesci being dead, and his
mother having become the wife of Sir Lancelot Threlkeld, a
rumour again arose and reached the court that the young
Lord Clifford was alive; whereupon his mother, with the
connivance and assistance of her husband, had the shepherd
with whom she had placed her son, removed with his wife
and family from Yorkshire to the more mountainous country
of Cumberland. In that wild and remote region, the persecuted
boy was "kept as a shepherd sometimes at Threlkeld amongst
his step-father's kindred, and sometimes upon the borders of
Scotland, where they took land purposely for those shepherds
who had the custody of him, where many times his step-father
came purposely to visit him, and sometimes his mother, though
very secretly."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>In this obscurity the heir of the Cliffords passed the
remainder of his boyhood, all his youth, and his early manhood;
haunting, in the pursuit of pastoral occupations, the
lofty moorland wastes at the foot of Blencathra, or musing in the
solitude of the stupendous heights of that "Peak of Witches;"
at other times, ranging amid the lonesome glens of Skiddaw
Forest, or on the bleak heath-clad hills of Caldbeck and
Carrock.</p>

<p>Thus being of necessity nurtured much in solitude, and,
habited in rustic garb, bred up to man's estate among the
simple dalesmen, to whom, as well as to himself, his rank and
station were unknown, he was reared in so great ignorance that
he could neither read nor write; for his parents durst not have
him instructed in any kind of learning, lest by it his birth
should be discovered; and when subsequently he was restored
to his title and estates, and took his place among his peers, he
never attained to higher proficiency in the art of writing than
barely enabled him to sign his name.</p>

<p>One of the first acts of Henry VII. was to restore the lowly
Clifford to his birthright and to all that had been possessed
by his noble ancestors. And his mother, who did not die till
the year 1493, lived to see him thus suddenly exalted from a
poor shepherd into a rich and powerful lord, at the age of one
and thirty.</p>

<p>In his retirement he had acquired great astronomical knowledge,
watching, like the Chaldeans of old time, the stars by
night upon the mountains, as is current from tradition in the
village and neighbourhood of Threlkeld at this day. And
when, on his restoration to his estates and honours, he had
become a great builder and repaired several of his castles, he
resided chiefly at Barden Tower, in Yorkshire, to be near the
Priory of Bolton; "to the end that he might have opportunity
to converse with some of the canons of that house, as it is said,
who were well versed in astronomy; unto which study having
a singular affection (perhaps in regard to his solitary shepherd's
life, which gave him time for contemplation,) he fitted himself
with diverse instruments for use therein."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>Whitaker, in like manner, represents the restored lord as
having brought to his new position "the manners and
education of a shepherd," and as being "at this time, almost,
if not altogether, illiterate." But it is added that he was "far
from deficient in natural understanding, and, what strongly
marks an ingenuous mind in a state of recent elevation,
depressed by a consciousness of his own deficiencies." If it
was on this account, as we are also told, that he retired to the
solitude of Barden, where he seems to have enlarged the
tower out of a common keeper's lodge, he found in it a retreat
equally favourable to taste, to instruction, and to devotion.
The narrow limits of his residence show that he had learned
to despise the pomp of greatness, and that a small train of
servants could suffice him, who had lived to the age of thirty
a servant himself.</p>

<p>Whitaker suspects Lord Clifford, however, "to have been
sometimes occupied in a more visionary pursuit, and probably
in the same company," namely, the canons of Bolton, from
having found among the family evidences two manuscripts on
the subject of Alchemy, which may almost certainly be referred
to the age in which he lived. If these were originally deposited
with the MSS. of the Cliffords, it might have been for the use
of this nobleman. If they were brought from Bolton at the
Dissolution, they must have been the work of those canons
with whom he almost exclusively conversed.</p>

<p>In these peaceful employments Lord Clifford spent the whole
reign of Henry VII., and the first years of that of his son.
His descendant the Countess of Pembroke describes him as a
plain man, who lived for the most part a country life, and
came seldom either to court or London, excepting when called
to Parliament, on which occasion he behaved himself like a
wise and good English nobleman. But in the year 1513,
when almost sixty years old, he was appointed to a principal
command over the army which fought at Flodden, and showed
that the military genius of the family had neither been chilled
in him by age, nor extinguished by habits of peace.</p>

<p>He survived the battle of Flodden ten years, and died April
23rd, 1523, aged about 70; having by his last will appointed
his body to be interred at Shap, if he died in Westmorland;
or at Bolton, if he died in Yorkshire. "I shall endeavour,"
says Whitaker, "to appropriate to him a tomb, vault, and
chantry, in the choir of the Church of Bolton, as I should be
sorry to believe that he was deposited, when dead, at a distance
from the place which in his life time he loved so well." There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>exists no memorial of his place of burial. The broken floors
and desecrated vaults of Shap and Bolton afford no trace or
record of his tomb. It is probable, however, that in one of
these sanctuaries he was laid to rest among the ashes of his
illustrious kindred.</p>

<p>The vault at Skipton Church was prepared for the remains
of his immediate descendants. Thither, with three of their
wives, and a youthful scion of their house, the boy Lord
Francis, were borne in succession the five Earls of Cumberland
of his name; when this their tomb finally closed over
the line of Clifford: the lady Anne choosing rather to lie
beside "her beloved mother," in the sepulchre which she had
erected for herself at Appleby, than with her martial ancestors
at Skipton.</p>

<p>Having thus been wonderfully preserved&mdash;says a writer
whose words have often been quoted in these pages&mdash;and
after twenty years of secretness and seclusion, having been
restored in blood and honours, to his barony, his lands, and
his castles; he, the Shepherd Lord, came forth upon the
world with a mind in advance of the age, a spirit of knowledge,
of goodness, and of light, such as was rarely seen in
that time of ignorance and superstition; averse to courtly
pomp, delighting himself chiefly in country pursuits, in repairing
his castles, and in learned intercourse with such
literate persons as he could find. He was the wisest of his
race, and falling upon more peaceful times, was enabled to
indulge in the studies and thoughtful dispositions which his
early misfortunes had induced and cultured. Throughout a
long life he remained one, whose precious example, though it
had but few imitators, and even exposed him to be regarded
with dread, as dealing in the occult sciences, and leagued with
beings that mortal man ought not to know, was nevertheless
so far appreciated by his less enlightened countrymen, that
his image was always linked in their memories and affections
with whatever was great and ennobling, and caused him to
be recorded to this, our day, by the endearing appellation of
the "Good Lord Clifford."</p>

<p>This nobleman was twice married,&mdash;first to Anne, daughter
of Sir John St. John of Bletsoe, cousin-germain to King
Henry the Seventh, by whom he had two sons and five
daughters. Lady Clifford was a woman of great goodness
and piety, who lived for the most part a country life in her
husband's castles in the North, during the twenty-one years
she remained his wife. His second wife was Florence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>daughter of Henry Pudsey, of Bolton, in Yorkshire, Esquire,
grandson of Sir Ralph Pudsey, the faithful protector of Henry
the Sixth after the overthrow of the Lancastrian cause at
Hexham. By her he had two or three sons, and one daughter,
Dorothy, who became the wife of Sir Hugh Lowther,
of Lowther, in Westmorland, and from whom the Earls of
Lonsdale are descended.</p>

<p>It is said that, towards the end of the first Lady Clifford's
life, her husband was unkind to her, and he had two or three
base children by another woman.</p>

<p>Lord Clifford was unfortunate in having great unkindness
and estrangement between himself and his oldest son Henry.
Early habits of friendship, on the part of the latter, with King
Henry VIII. and a strong passion for parade and greatness,
seem to have robbed his heart of filial affection. The pure
simplicity and unequivocal openness of his father's manners
had long been an offence to his pride; but the old man's
alliance with Florence Pudsey provoked his irreconcilable
aversion. By his follies and vices, also, the latter years of
his father were sorely disturbed. That wild and dissolute
young nobleman, attaching himself to a troop of roystering
followers, led a bandit's life, oppressed the lieges, harassed
the religious houses, beat the tenants, and forced the inhabitants
of whole villages to take sanctuary in their churches. He
afterwards reformed, and was employed in all the armies sent
into Scotland by Henry the Seventh and his successor, where
he ever behaved himself nobly and valiantly; and subsequently
became one of the most eminent men of his time, and
within two years after his father's death, having been through
life a personal friend and favourite of Henry the Eighth, was
elevated by that partial monarch to the dignity of Earl of
Cumberland, which title he held till his decease in 1542. It
has been conjectured, but on no sufficient grounds, that he was
the hero of the ballad of "The Nut-Brown Maid."</p>

<p>In addition to the members of this distinguished family who
have already been enumerated as attaining to great personal
distinction, may be named George, the third of the five Earls
of Cumberland, the favourite of Queen Elizabeth, called the
"Great Sea-faring Lord Clifford," an accomplished courtier as
well as naval hero,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> one of those to whom England is indebted
for her proud title of "the Ocean Queen." And lastly, his
daughter, the Lady Anne Clifford, Countess of Dorset, Pembroke,
and Montgomery, of famous memory, one of the most
celebrated women of her time.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>About three miles from Threlkeld, the ancient home of Sir
Lancelot Threlkeld and his noble step-son, stands as the eastern
barrier of the Blencathra group of mountains, that part of it
which is known as Souter Fell; whose irregular and precipitous
summit, everywhere difficult of access, rises to a
height of about 2,500 feet. It is on the south of Bowscale Fell,
leaning westward from the Hesketh and Carlisle road, by
which its eastern base is skirted. This mountain is celebrated
in local history as having several times been the scene of those
singular aerial phenomena known as mirages. A tradition of
a spectral army having been seen marching over these mountains
had long been current in the neighbourhood, and this
remarkable exhibition was actually witnessed in the years
1735, 1737, and 1745, by several independent parties of the
dalesmen; and, as may well be supposed, excited much
attention in the north of England, and long formed a subject
of superstitious fear and wonder in the surrounding district.
A sight so strange as that of the whole side of the mountain
appearing covered with troops, both infantry and cavalry,
who after going through regular military evolutions for more
than an hour, defiled off in good order, and disappeared over
a precipitous ridge on the summit, was sure to be the subject
of much speculation and enquiry. Many persons at a distance
hearing of the phenomenon, proceeded to the places where it
was witnessed, purposely to examine the spectators who asserted
the fact, and who continued positive in their assertions
as to the appearances. Amongst others, one of the contributors
to Hutchinson's History of Cumberland went to inquire
into the subject; and the following is the account of the information
he obtained, given in his own words.</p>

<p>"On Midsummer Eve 1735, William Lancaster's servant
related that he saw the east side of Souter Fell, towards the
top, covered with a regular marching army for above an hour
together; he said they consisted of distinct bodies of troops,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>which appeared to proceed from an eminence in the north
end, and marched over a nitch in the top, but as no other
person in the neighbourhood had seen the like, he was discredited
and laughed at.</p>

<p>"Two years after, on Midsummer Eve also, betwixt the hours
of eight and nine, William Lancaster himself imagined that
several gentlemen were following their horses at a distance, as
if they had been hunting, and taking them for such, paid no
regard to it, till about ten minutes after, again turning his
head to the place, they appeared to be mounted, and a vast
army following, five in rank, crowding over at the same place,
where the servant said he saw them two years before. He
then called his family, who all agreed in the same opinion;
and what was most extraordinary, he frequently observed that
some one of the five would quit the rank, and seem to stand
in a fronting posture, as if he was observing and regulating
the order of their march, or taking account of the numbers,
and after some time appeared to return full gallop to the
station he had left, which they never failed to do as often as
they quitted their lines, and the figure that did so was one of
the middlemost men in the rank. As it grew later they
seemed more regardless of discipline, and rather had the appearance
of people riding from a market, than an army,
though they continued crowding on, and marching off, as
long as they had light to see them.</p>

<p>"This phenomenon was no more seen till the Midsummer
Eve, which preceded the rebellion, when they were determined
to call more families to witness this sight, and accordingly
went to Wiltonhill and Souther Fell-side, till they convened
about twenty-six persons, who all affirm that they saw
the same appearance, but not conducted with the usual
regularity as the preceding ones, having the likeness of carriages
interspersed; however it did not appear to be less real,
for some of the company were so affected with it as in the
morning to climb the mountain, through an idle expectation
of finding horse shoes, after so numerous an army, but they
saw not a vestige or print of a foot.</p>

<p>"William Lancaster, indeed, told me, that he never concluded
they were real beings, because of the impracticability
of a march over the precipices, where they seemed to come
on; that the night was extremely serene; that horse and
man, upon strict looking at, appeared to be but one being,
rather than two distinct ones; that they were nothing like
any clouds or vapours, which he had ever perceived elsewhere;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>that their number was incredible, for they filled
lengthways near half a mile, and continued so in a swift
march for above an hour, and much longer he thinks if night
had kept off."</p>

<p>The writer adds,&mdash;"This whole story has so much the air
of a romance, that it seemed fitter for <i>Amadis de Gaul</i>, or
<i>Glenvilles System of Witches</i>, than the repository of the learned;
but as the country was full of it, I only give it verbatim from
the original relation of a people, that could have no end in
imposing upon their fellow-creatures, and are of good repute
in the place where they live."</p>

<p>Not less circumstantial is the account of this remarkable
phenomenon gathered from the same sources by Mr. James
Clarke, the intelligent author of the Survey of the Lakes;
and which account, he says, "perhaps can scarcely be paralleled
by history, or reconciled to probability; such, however,
is the evidence we have of it," he continues, "that I
cannot help relating it, and then my readers must judge for
themselves. I shall give it nearly in the words of Mr. Lancaster
of <i>Blakehills</i>, from whom I had the account; and
whose veracity, even were it not supported by many concurrent
testimonies, I could fully rely upon. The story is as
follows:</p>

<p>"On the 23rd of June 1744 (Qu. 45?), his father's servant,
Daniel Stricket (who now lives under Skiddaw, and is an
auctioneer), about half past seven in the evening was walking
a little above the house. Looking round him he saw a troop
of men on horseback riding on <i>Souther Fell-side</i>, (a place so
steep that an horse can scarcely travel on it at all,) in pretty
close ranks and at a brisk walk. Stricket looked earnestly at
them some time before he durst venture to acquaint any one
with what he saw, as he had the year before made himself
ridiculous by a visionary story, which I beg leave here also to
relate: He was at that time servant to John Wren of <i>Wiltonhill</i>,
the next house to <i>Blakehills</i>, and sitting one evening
after supper at the door along with his master, they saw a
man with a dog pursuing some horses along Souther Fell-side;
and they seemed to run at an amazing pace, till they got out
of sight at the low end of the Fell. This made them resolve to
go next morning to the place to pick up the shoes which they
thought these horses must have lost in galloping at such a
furious rate; they expected likewise to see prodigious grazes
from the feet of these horses on the steep side of the mountain,
and to find the man lying dead, as they were sure he run
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>so fast that he must kill himself. Accordingly they went,
but, to their great surprise, found not a shoe, nor even a single
vestige of any horse having been there, much less did they
find the man lying dead as they had expected. This story they
some time concealed; at length, however, they ventured to
tell it, and were (as might be expected) heartily laughed at.
Stricket, conscious of his former ridiculous error, observed
these aerial troops some time before he ventured to mention
what he saw; at length, fully satisfied that what he saw was
real, he went into the house, and told Mr. Lancaster he had
something curious to show him. Mr. Lancaster asked him
what it was, adding, "I suppose some bonefire," (for it was
then, and still is a custom, for the shepherds, on the evening
before St. John's day, to light bonefires, and vie with each
other in having the largest.) Stricket told him, if he would
walk with him to the end of the house he would show him
what it was. They then went together, and before Stricket
spoke or pointed to the place, Mr. Lancaster himself discovered
the phenomenon, and said to Stricket, "Is that
what thou hast to show me?" "Yes, Master," replied
Stricket: "Do you think you see as I do?" They found
they did see alike, so they went and alarmed the family,
who all came, and all saw this strange phenomenon.</p>

<p>"These visionary horsemen seemed to come from the lowest
part of Souther Fell, and became visible first at a place called
<span class="smcap">Knott</span>: they then moved in regular troops along the side of
the Fell, till they came opposite <i>Blakehills</i>, when they went
over the mountain: thus they described a kind of curvilineal
path upon the side of the Fell, and both their first and last
appearance were bounded by the top of the mountain.</p>

<p>"Frequently the last, or last but one, in a troop, (always
either the one or the other,) would leave his place, gallop to
the front, and then take the same pace with the rest, a <i>regular,
swift walk</i>: these changes happened to every troop, (for many
troops appeared,) and oftener than once or twice, yet not at
all times alike. The spectators saw, <i>all alike</i>, the same
changes, and at the same time, as they discovered by asking
each other questions as any change took place. Nor was this
wonderful phenomenon seen at Blakehills only, it was seen by
<i>every</i> person at <i>every cottage</i> within the distance of a mile;
neither was it confined to a momentary view, for from the
time that Stricket first observed it, the appearance must have
lasted at least two hours and a half, viz. from half past seven,
till the night coming on prevented the farther view; nor yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>was the distance such as could impose rude resemblances on
the eyes of credulity: <i>Blakehills</i> lay not half a mile from the
place where this astonishing appearance <i>seemed</i> to be, and
many other places where it was likewise seen are still nearer."</p>

<p>This account is attested by the signatures of William Lancaster
and Daniel Stricket, and dated the 21st day of July
1785.</p>

<p>"Thus I have given," continues Mr. Clark, "the best
account I can procure of this wonderful appearance; let
others determine what it was. This country, like every other
where cultivation has been lately introduced, abounds in the
<i>aniles fabellæ</i> of fairies, ghosts, and apparitions; but these are
never even <i>fabled</i> to have been seen by more than one or two
persons at a time, and the view is always said to be momentary.
Speed tells of something indeed similar to this as preceding
a dreadful intestine war. Can something of this nature
have given rise to Ossian's grand and awful mythology? or,
finally, Is there any impiety in supposing, as this happened
immediately before that rebellion which was intended to subvert
the liberty, the law, and the religion of England; that
though immediate prophecies have ceased, these visionary
beings might be directed to warn mankind of approaching
<i>tumults</i>? In short, it is difficult to say what it was, or what
it was not."</p>

<p>Sir David Brewster, in his work on <i>Natural Magic</i>, after
quoting this narrative from Mr. James Clark, which he describes
as "one of the most interesting accounts of aerial
spectres with which we are acquainted," continues&mdash;"These
extraordinary sights were received not only with distrust, but
with absolute incredulity. They were not even honoured
with a place in the records of natural phenomena, and the
philosophers of the day were neither in possession of analagous
facts, nor were they acquainted with those principles of
atmospherical refraction upon which they depend. The strange
phenomena, indeed, of the <i>Fata Morgana</i>, or the <i>Castles
of the Fairy Mor-Morgana</i>, had been long before observed,
and had been described by Kircher, in the 17th century, but
they presented nothing so mysterious as the aerial troopers of
Souter Fell; and the general characters of the two phenomena
were so unlike, that even a philosopher might have been excused
for ascribing them to different causes."</p>

<p>The accepted explanation of this appearance now is, that
on the evenings in question, the rebel Scotch troops were performing
their military evolutions on the west coast of Scotland,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>and that by some peculiar refraction of the atmosphere
their movements were reflected on this mountain. Phenomena
similar to these were seen near Stockton-on-the-Forest, in
Yorkshire, in 1792; in Harrogate, on June 28th, 1812;
and near St. Neot's, in Huntingdonshire, in 1820. Tradition
also records the tramp of armies over Helvellyn, on the eve
of the battle of Marston Moor. To these may be added the
appearance of the Spectre of the Brocken in the Hartz Mountains;
and an instance mentioned by Hutchinson, that in the
spring of the year 1707, early on a serene still morning, two
persons who were walking from one village to another in
Leicestershire, observed a like appearance of an army marching
along, till, going behind a great hill, it disappeared. The
forms of pikes and carbines were distinguishable, the march
was not entirely in one direction, but was at first like the
junction of two armies, and the meeting of generals.</p>

<p>Aerial phenomena of a like nature are recorded by Livy,
Josephus, and Suetonius; and a passage in Sacred History
seems to refer to a similar circumstance. See Judges ix. 36.</p>

<p>Many in this country considered these appearances as
ominous of the great waste of blood spilt by Britain in her
wars with America and France. Shakespeare says, in <i>Julius
Cæsar</i>,</p>

<div class="poem">
"When these prodigies<br />
Do so conjointly meet, let not men say,<br />
&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;they are natural;<br />
For, I believe, they are portentous things<br />
Unto the climate that they point upon."<br />

<h2>PAN ON KIRKSTONE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Not always in fair Grecian bowers<br />
Piped ancient Pan, to charm the hours.<br />
Once in a thousand years he stray'd<br />
Round earth, and all his realms survey'd.<br />
<br />
And fairer in the world were none<br />
Than those bright scenes he look'd upon,<br />
Where Ulph's sweet lake her valleys woo'd,<br />
And Windar all her isles renew'd.<br />
<br />
For, long ere Kirkstone's rugged brow<br />
Was worn by mortal feet as now,<br />
Great Pan himself the Pass had trod,<br />
And rested on the heights, a God!<br />
<br />
Who climbs from Ulph's fair valley sees,<br />
Still midway couched on Kirkstone-Screes,<br />
Old as the hills, his Dog on high,<br />
At gaze athwart the southern sky.<br />
<br />
A rock, upon that rocky lair,<br />
It lives from out the times that were,<br />
When hairy Pan his soul to cheer<br />
Look'd from those heights on Windermere.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><br />
There piped he on his reed sweet lays,<br />
Piped his great heart's delight and praise;<br />
While Nature, answering back each tone,<br />
Joy'd the glad fame to find her own.<br />
<br />
"Could I, while men at distance keep,"<br />
Said Pan, "in yon bright waters peep,<br />
And watch their ripples come and go,<br />
And see what treasures hide below!<br />
<br />
"Rivall'd is my fair Greece's store,<br />
My own Parnassian fields and shore!<br />
I will delight me, and behold<br />
Myself in yon bright Mere of gold."<br />
<br />
Like thought, his Dog sprang to yon lair<br />
To watch the heights and sniff the air:<br />
Like thought, on Helm a Lion frown'd,<br />
To guard the northern Pass's bound:<br />
<br />
And with his mate a mighty Pard<br />
On Langdale-head, kept watchful ward:&mdash;<br />
That great God Pan his soul might cheer,<br />
Glass'd in the depths of Windermere.<br />
<br />
Then down the dell from steep to steep,<br />
With many a wild and wayward leap,<br />
The God descending stood beside<br />
His image on the golden tide.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><br />
His shaggy sides in full content<br />
He sunn'd, and o'er the waters bent;<br />
Then hugg'd himself the reeds among,<br />
And piped his best Arcadian song.<br />
<br />
What was it, as he knelt and drew<br />
The wave to sip, that pierced him through?<br />
What whispered sound, what stifled roar,<br />
Has reached him listening on the shore?<br />
<br />
He shivers on the old lake stones;<br />
He leans, aghast, to catch the groans<br />
Which come like voices uttering woe<br />
Up all the streams, and bid him go.<br />
<br />
Onward the looming troubles roll,<br />
All centring towards his mighty soul.<br />
He shriek'd! and in a moment's flight,<br />
Stunn'd, through the thickets plunged from sight.<br />
<br />
Plunged he, his unking'd head to hide<br />
With goats and herds in forests wide?<br />
Or down beneath the rocks to lie,<br />
Shut in from leaves, and fields, and sky?<br />
<br />
Gone was the great God out from earth!<br />
Gone, with his pipe of tuneful mirth!<br />
Whither, and wherefore, men may say<br />
Who stood where Pilate mused that day.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><br />
And with that breath that crisp'd the rills,<br />
And with that shock that smote the hills,<br />
A moment Nature sobb'd and mourn'd,<br />
And things of life to rocks were turned.<br />
<br />
Stricken to stone in heart and limb,<br />
Like all things else that followed him,<br />
Yonder his Dog lies watching still<br />
For Pan's lost step to climb the hill.<br />
<br />
And those twin Pards, huge, worn with time,<br />
Stretch still their rocky lengths sublime,<br />
Where once they watched to guard from man<br />
The sportive mood of great God Pan.<br />
<br />
And craggy Helm's grey Lion rears<br />
The mane he shook in those old years,<br />
In changeless stone, from morn to morn<br />
Awaiting still great Pan's return.<br />
<br />
Could he come back again, to range<br />
The earth, how much must all things change!<br />
Not Nature's self, even rock and stone,<br />
Would deign her perished God to own.<br />
<br />
The former life all fled away&mdash;<br />
No custom'd haunt to bid him stay&mdash;<br />
No flower on earth, no orb on high,<br />
No place, to know him&mdash;Pan must die.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><br />
Down with his age he went to rest;<br />
His great heart, stricken in his breast<br />
By tidings from that far-off shore,<br />
Burst&mdash;and great Pan was King no more!<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "PAN ON KIRKSTONE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The sudden trouble and annihilation of Pan have reference
to a passage in Plutarch, in his <i>Treatise on Oracles</i>, in which
he relates that at the time of the Crucifixion, a voice was
heard by certain mariners, sweeping over the Egean Sea, and
crying "Pan is dead"; and the Oracles ceased. This idea,
so beautifully expressing the overthrow of Paganism, and the
flight of the old gods, at the inauguration of Christianity,
Milton has finely elaborated in his sublime "Hymn on the
Morning of the Nativity."</p>

<p>Many of the mountains in the North of England derive
their name from some peculiarity of form: as <i>Helm-Crag</i> in
Grasmere, <i>Saddle-Back</i> near Keswick, <i>Great Gable</i> at the
head of Wast-Water, <i>The Pillar</i> in Ennerdale, <i>The Hay
Stacks</i>, <i>The Haycocks</i>, <i>High Stile</i>, <i>Steeple</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>There are also very marked resemblances to animate objects,
well known to those familiar with the Lake District, as
the <i>Lion and the Lamb</i> on the summit of Helm-Crag; the
<i>Astrologer</i>, or <i>Old woman cowering</i>, on the same spot when
seen from another quarter; the rude similitude of a female
colossal statue, which gives the name of <i>Eve's Crag</i> to a cliff
in the vale of Derwentwater. An interesting and but little
known Arthurian reminiscence is found in the old legend that
the recumbent effigy of that great king may be traced from
some parts of the neighbourhood of Penrith in the outlines of
the mountain range of which the peaks of Saddleback form
the most prominent points. From the little hill of Castle
Head or Castlet, the royal face of George the Third with its
double chin, short nose, and receding forehead, can be quite
made out in the crowning knob of Causey Pike. From under
Barf, near Bassenthwaite Water, is seen the form which gives
name to the <i>Apostle's Crag</i>. At a particular spot, the solemn
shrouded figure comes out with bowed head and reverent
mien, as if actually detaching itself from the rock&mdash;a vision
seen by the passer by only for a few yards, when the magic
ceases, and the Apostle goes back to stone. The massy
forms of the Langdale Pikes, as seen from the south east,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>with the sweeping curve of Pavey Ark behind, are strikingly
suggestive of two gigantic lions or pards, crouching side by
side, with their breasts half turned towards the spectator. And
a remarkable figure of a shepherd's dog, but of no great size,
may be seen stretched out on a jutting crag, about half way
up the precipice which overhangs the road, as the summit of
Kirkstone Pass is approached from Brother's Water. It is
not strictly, as stated in the foregoing verses, on the part of
Kirkstone Fell called Red Screes, but some distance below it
on the Patterdale side.</p>

<p>Among the freaks of Nature occasionally to be found in
these hilly regions, is the print of the heifer's foot in Borrowdale,
shown by the guides; and on a stone near Buck-Crag
in Eskdale, the impressions of the foot of a man, a boy, and a
dog, without any marks of tooling or instrument; and the remarkable
precipices of Doe-Crag and Earn-Crag, whose
fronts are polished as marble, the one 160 yards in perpendicular
height, the other 120 yards.</p>

<p>On the top of the Screes, above Wastwater, stood for ages
a very large stone called Wilson's Horse; which about a century
ago fell down into the lake, when a cleft was made
one hundred yards long, four feet wide, and of incredible
depth.</p></blockquote>

<h2>ST. BEGA AND THE SNOW MIRACLE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The seas will rise though saints on board<br />
Commend their frail skiff to the Lord.<br />
And Bega and her holy band<br />
Are shipwrecked on the Cumbrian strand.<br />
<br />
"Give me," she asked, "for me and mine,<br />
O Lady of high Bretwalda's line!<br />
Give, for His sake who succoured thee,<br />
A shelter for these maids and me."&mdash;<br />
<br />
Then sew'd, and spun, and crewl-work wrought,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a><br />
And served the poor they meekly taught,<br />
These virgins good; and show'd the road<br />
By blameless lives to Heaven and God.<br />
<br />
They won from rude men love and praise;<br />
They lived unmoved through evil days;<br />
And only longed for a home to rise<br />
To store up treasures for the skies.<br />
<br />
That pious wish the Lady's bower<br />
Has reached; and forth she paced the tower:&mdash;<br />
"My gracious Lord! of thy free hand<br />
Grant this good Saint three roods of land.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><br />
"Three roods, where she may rear a pile,<br />
To sing God's praise through porch and aisle;<br />
And, serving Him, us too may bless<br />
For sheltering goodness in distress."<br />
<br />
The Earl he turned him gaily near,<br />
Laughed lightly in his Lady's ear&mdash;<br />
"By this bright Eve of blessed St. John!<br />
I'll give&mdash;what the snow to-morrow lies on."<br />
<br />
His Lady roused him at dawn with smiles&mdash;<br />
"The snow lies white for miles and miles!"<br />
From loophole and turret he stares on the sight<br />
Of Midsummer-morning clothed in white.<br />
<br />
"&mdash;Well done, good Saint! the lands are thine.<br />
Go, build thy church, and deck thy shrine.<br />
I 'bate no jot of my plighted word,<br />
Though lightly spoken and lightly heard.<br />
<br />
"If mirth and my sweet Lady's grace<br />
Have lost me many a farm and chace,<br />
I know that power unseen belongs<br />
To holy ways and Christian songs.<br />
<br />
"And He, who thee from wind and wave<br />
Deliverance and a refuge gave,<br />
When we must brave a gloomier sea,<br />
May hear thy prayers for mine and me."<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "ST. BEGA AND THE SNOW
MIRACLE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The remains of the Monastery of St. Bees, about four miles
south of Whitehaven, stand in a low situation, with marshy
lands to the east, and on the west exposed to storms from
the Irish Channel.</p>

<p>In respect to this religious foundation, Tanner says, "Bega,
an holy woman from Ireland is said to have founded, about
the year 650, a small monastery in Copeland, where afterwards
a church was built in memory of her. This religious
house being destroyed by the Danes, was restored by William,
brother to Ranulph de Meschines, Earl of Cumberland, in the
time of King Henry I., and made a cell for a prior and six
Benedictine monks, to the Abbey of St. Mary, York."</p>

<p>The earliest documents connected with this place call it
<i>Kirkby-Begogh</i>, the market town of St. Bega; and <i>St. Bee</i>,
or <i>St. Bees</i>, the Saint's house or houses, names given to it
<i>after</i> the Irish Saint resided there.</p>

<p>St. Bega is said to have been the daughter of an Irish king,
"who was a Christian, and an earnest man, to boot." He
wished to marry his daughter to a Norwegian prince; but
she, having determined to be a nun, ran away from her
father's house, and joining some strange sailors, took ship,
and sailed to the coast of Cumberland.</p>

<p>The accounts given of the first foundation of the nunnery of
St. Bees are very contradictory, the common version being
the traditionary account in Mr. Sandford's MS., namely, that
the extent of the territories was originally designated by a
preternatural fall of snow, through the prayers of the Saint,
on the eve of St. John's or Midsummer day. From this MS.
it would appear that a ship, containing a lady abbess and her
sisters, being "driven in by stormy weather at Whitehaven,"
the abbess applied for relief to the lady of Egremont, who,
taking compassion on her destitution, obtained of her lord a
dwelling place for them, "at the now St. Bees;" where
they "sewed and spinned, and wrought carpets and other
work and lived very godly lives, as got them much love."
It goes on to say that the lady of Egremont, at the request of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the abbess, spoke to her lord to give them some land "to lay
up treasure in heaven," and that "he laughed and said he
would give them as much as snow fell upon the next morning,
being Midsummer day; and on the morrow as he looked out
of his castle window, all was white with snow for three miles
together. And thereupon builded this St. Bees Abbie, and
gave all those lands was snowen unto it, and the town and
haven of Whitehaven, &amp;c."</p>

<p>The "Life of Sancta Bega," however, a latin chronicle of
the Middle Ages, in which are recorded the acts of the Saint,
gives the Snow Miracle somewhat differently, and places it
many years after the death of the mild recluse, in the time of
Ranulph de Meschines. The monkish historian relates that
certain persons had instilled into the ears of that nobleman,
that the monks had unduly extended their possessions. A
dispute arose on this subject, for the settlement of which, by
the prayers of the religious, "invoking most earnestly the
intercession of their advocate the blessed Bega," the whole
land became white with snow, except the territories of the
church which stood forth dry.</p>

<p>It is certain that the name of <i>Sancta Bega</i> is inseparably
connected with the Snow Miracle; but the anachronism which
refers the former of the accounts just given to the period of
William de Meschines would seem to show that the narrator
has mixed up the circumstances attending its foundation in the
middle of the seventh century with its restoration in the
twelfth; for, says Denton, "the said Lord William de Meschines
seated himself at Egremont, where he built a castle upon
a sharp topped hill, and thereupon called the same <i>Egremont</i>."
This writer elsewhere says, "The bounders of
William Meschines aforesaid, which he gave the priory are
in these words: 'Totam terram et vis totum feodum inter has
divisas, viz. a pede de Whit of Haven ad Kekel, et per Kekel
donec cadit in Eyre et per Eyre quousque in mare.' Kekel
runneth off from Whillymore by Cleator and Egremont, and
so into Eyne; at Egremont Eyre is the foot of Eyne, which
falleth out of Eynerdale."</p>

<p>The monkish version of the legend, therefore, refers to
William de Meschines, as the Lord of Egremont, and to the
lands which were given by him at the restoration of the Priory
in the twelfth century: whilst that related by Sandford alludes
to some other powerful chief, who, in the life time of the
Saint in the seventh century had his seat at Egremont, which,
as has been stated elsewhere, "was probably a place of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>strength during the Heptarchy, and in the time of the Danes."</p>

<p>It might almost seem as if some such legend as that of the
Snow Miracle were necessary to account for the singular form
of this extensive and populous parish: which includes the
large and opulent town of Whitehaven; the five chapelries of
Hensingham, Ennerdale, Eskdale, Wastdale-Head, and Nether-Wastdale;
and the townships of St. Bees, Ennerdale,
Ennerdale High End, Eskdale and Wastdale, Hensingham,
Kinneyside, Lowside-Quarter, Nether-Wastdale, Preston-Quarter,
Rottington, Sandwith, Weddicar, and Whitehaven.
It extends ten miles along the coast, and reaches far inland,
so that some of its chapelries are ten and fourteen miles from
the mother-church.</p>

<p>In the monkish chronicle of the Life and Miracles of Sancta
Bega occurs the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A certain celebration had come round by annual revolution
which the men of that land use to solemnise by a most holy
Sabbath on the eve of Pentecost, on account of certain tokens
of the sanctity of the holy virgin then found there, which they
commemorate, and they honor her church by visiting it with
offerings of prayers and oblations."<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In allusion to which, Mr. Tomlinson the editor and translator
of the MS. observes that "this is another of those marks
of dependence of the surrounding chapelries which formerly
existed; a mark the more interesting because to this day some
traces of it remain. Communicants still annually resort to
the church of St. Bees at the festival of Easter from considerable
distances; and the village presents an unusual appearance
from their influx; and at the church the eucharist is
administered as early as eight in the morning, in addition to
the celebration of it at the usual time. There can be no doubt
but that Whitsuntide, and perhaps Christmas, as well as Easter,
were formerly seasons when the church of St. Bees was resorted
to by numbers who appeared within it at no other
time, save perhaps at the burial of their friends. The great
festivals of the church appear in the middle ages to have been
considered by the English as peculiarly auspicious for the
solemnization of marriages. At these seasons then, from concurring
causes, the long-drawn solemn processions of priests
and people would be chiefly seen, and then also, the accustomed
oblations of the latter to the mother church of St.
Bees would be discharged."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>As to the "town and haven of Whitehaven" included in
the gift to "St. Bees Abbie," its eligibility as a fishing
ground, when the tides ran nearer the meadows than at present,
would doubtless attract the attention of the monks of
St. Bees; and the fact of its being denominated <i>Whittofthaven</i>,
<i>Quitofthaven</i>, <i>Wythoven</i>, <i>Whyttothaven</i>, <i>Whitten</i>, &amp;c.,
in the register of St. Bees and other ancient records, evidently
shows that it is a place of greater antiquity than has generally
been ascribed to it; and some fragments of tradition, still
extant, seem to countenance this opinion.</p>

<p>Denton (MS.) speaking of Whitehaven or White-Toft
Haven, says "It was belonging to St. Beghs of antient time,
for the Abbot of York, in Edward I.'s time was impleaded for
wreck, and his liberties there, by the King, which he claimed
from the foundation, to be confirmed by Richard Lucy, in
King John's time, to his predecessors."</p>

<p>That Whitehaven was anciently a place of resort for shipping
appears from some particulars respecting it mentioned in
those remarkable Irish documents, called the <i>Annals of the
Four Masters</i>, much of which was written at the Abbey of
Monesterboice, in the county of Louth&mdash;nearly opposite, on
the Irish shore. In the account of the domestic habits and
manufactures of the Irish, it is stated that their <i>coracles</i>, or
<i>Wicker Boats</i>, their Noggins, and other domestic utensils,
were made of wood called <i>Wythe</i> or <i>Withey</i>, brought from
the opposite shore of <i>Baruch</i> (i.e. rocky coast) and that a
small colony was placed there for the purpose of collecting
this wood. That Barach mouth, or Barrow mouth, and
Barrow mouth wood is the same as that alluded to by the
Four Masters, is evident from the legend of St. Bega, which
places it in the same locality; and that the colony of Celts
resided in the neighbourhood of the now <i>Celts</i>, or <i>Kell's Pit</i>,
in the same locality also, is manifest from the name. About
the year 930, it appears that one of the Irish princes or chiefs,
accompanied an expedition to this place for wood (for that a
great portion of the site of the present town and the neighbouring
heights were formerly covered with forest trees there
can be no doubt) and that the inhabitants who were met at
<i>Whitten</i>, or <i>Wittenagemote</i>, fell upon and look the chief and
several of the accompanying expedition prisoners from a
jealousy of their sanctuary being invaded. Many of the Irish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>utensils were imported hither, particularly the <i>noggin</i>, or
small water pail, which was made of closely woven wickerwork,
and covered inside with skin, having a projecting
handle for the purpose of dipping into a river or well. The
same article, in its primitive shape, though made of a different
material, called a <i>geggin</i>, is still used by some of the
farmers in that neighbourhood. When <i>Adam de Harris</i> gave
lands at Bransty Beck to the church of Holm Cultram, he
also gave privilege to the monks to cut wood for making
geggins or noggins.</p>

<p>From an old history of the county of Durham, Whitehaven
appears to have been a resort for shipping in the tenth century;
and when the Nevills of Raby were called upon to furnish
their quota of men to accompany Henry in his expedition
to Ireland in 1172, they were brought to <i>Wythop-haven</i>,
or <i>Witten-haven</i>, and transported thence in ships to the Irish
coast. When Edward was advancing against Scotland, in
the fourteenth century, he found a ship belonging to this
place, in which he sent a cargo of oats, to be ground by the
monks of St. Bees.</p>

<p>In nearly all histories of Cumberland, the name of Whitehaven
has been attributed either to some imaginary whiteness
of the rocks on the east side of the harbour, or to the cognomen
of an old fisherman who resided there about the year 1566, at
which time the town is said to have had only six houses. In
1633 it consisted of only nine thatched cottages. Sir Christopher
Lowther, second son of Sir John Lowther, purchased
Whitehaven and the lands lying in its neighbourhood, and
built a mansion on the west end of the haven at the foot of a
rock. He died in 1644, and was succeeded by his son, Sir
John Lowther, who erected a new mansion on the site of the
present castle, described by Mr. Denton, in 1688, as a
"stately new pile of building, called the Flatt," and having
conceived the project of working the coal mines, and improving
the harbour, he obtained from Charles the Second, about the
year 1666, a grant of all the "derelict land at this place,"
which yet remained in the crown; and in 1678, all the lands
for two miles northward, between high and low water mark,
the latter grant containing about 150 acres. Sir John having
thus laid the foundation of the future importance of Whitehaven,
commenced his great work, and lived to see a small
obscure village grow up into a thriving and populous town.</p>

<p>There is a traditionary account of the existence of an ancient
ruin where the castle stands (probably Druidical; or, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>at a later period, the Whitten, or Wittenagemote, was held)
the remains of which were broken up about the year 1628.
Respecting these real or imaginary stones it has been related,
that the inhabitants believed them to be enchanted warriors,
and gave them the appellation of "<i>Dread Ring</i>, or <i>Circle</i>,"
and occasionally "<i>Corpse Circle</i>"&mdash;corrupted into the word
<i>Corkickle</i>, the name which the locality now bears.</p>

<p>A reminiscence of the old mansion of the Lowthers is
preserved by the road which skirts the precincts of the castle.
This is still called, by the older townspeople, the Flatt
Walk.</p></blockquote>


<h3>CREWL-WORK.</h3>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Krull</i>, or <i>Crewel</i>, is a word evidently derived from the old
Norse <i>Krulla</i>, signifying to blend, to mix, and also to curl;
in fact, "crewel" work is embroidery, the Berlin wool work of
modern days; but the word is generally applied, in this
locality, to the covering of a hand ball with worsted work
of various colours and devices, the tribute of mothers and
sisters in our boyhood.

<h2>HART'S-HORN TREE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
When wild deer ranged the forest free,<br />
Mid Whinfell oaks stood Hart's-Horn Tree;<br />
Which, for three hundred years and more,<br />
Upon its stem the antlers bore<br />
Of that thrice-famous Hart-of-Grease<br />
That ran the race with Hercules.<br />
<br />
The King of Scots, to hunt the game<br />
With brave de Clifford southward came:<br />
Pendragon, Appleby, and Brough'm,<br />
Gave all his bold retainers room;<br />
And all came gathering to the chase<br />
Which ended in that matchless race.<br />
<br />
Beneath a mighty oak at morn<br />
The stag was roused with bugle horn;<br />
Unleashed, de Clifford's noblest Hound<br />
Rushed to the chase with strenuous bound;<br />
And stretching forth, the Hart-of-Grease<br />
Led off with famous Hercules.<br />
<br />
They ran, and northward held their way;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><br />
They ran till dusk, from dawning grey;<br />
O'er Cumbrian waste, and Border moor,<br />
Till England's line was speeded o'er;<br />
And Red-kirk on the Scottish ground<br />
Mark'd of their chase the farthest bound.<br />
<br />
Then turned they southward, stretching on,<br />
They ran till day was almost gone;<br />
Till Eamont came again in view;<br />
Till Whinfell oaks again they knew;<br />
They ran, and reached at eve the place<br />
Where first began their desperate race.<br />
<br />
They panted on, till almost broke<br />
Each beast's strong heart with its own stroke!<br />
They panted on, both well nigh blind,<br />
The Hart before, the Hound behind!<br />
And now will strength the Hart sustain<br />
To take him o'er the pale again?<br />
<br />
He sprang his best; that leap has won<br />
His triumph, but his chase is done!<br />
He lies stone dead beyond the bound;<br />
And stretched on this side lies the Hound!<br />
His last bold spring to clear the wall<br />
Was vain; and life closed with his fall.<br />
<br />
The steeds had fail'd, squires', knights', and king's,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><br />
Long ere the chase reached Solway's springs!<br />
But on the morrow news came in<br />
To Brough'm, amidst the festive din,<br />
How held the chase, how far, how wide<br />
It swerved and swept, and where they died.<br />
<br />
Ah! gallant pair! such chase before<br />
Was never seen, nor shall be more:<br />
And Scotland's King and England's Knight<br />
Looked, mutely wondering, on the sight,<br />
Where with that wall of stone between<br />
Lay Hart and Hound stretched on the green.<br />
<br />
Then spoke the King&mdash;"For equal praise<br />
This hand their monument shall raise!<br />
These antlers from this Oak shall spread;<br />
And evermore shall here be said,<br />
That Hercules killed Hart-of-Grease,<br />
And Hart-of-Grease killed Hercules.<br />
<br />
"From Whinfell woods to Red-kirk plain,<br />
And back to Whinfell Oaks again,<br />
Not fourscore English miles would tell!<br />
But"&mdash;said the King&mdash;"they spann'd it well.<br />
And by my kingdom, I will say<br />
They ran a noble race that day!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
Then said de Clifford to the King&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><br />
"Through many an age this feat shall ring!<br />
But of your Majesty I crave<br />
That Hercules may have his grave<br />
In ground beneath these branches free,<br />
From this day forth called Hart's-Horn Tree."<br />
<br />
And there where both were 'reft of life,<br />
And both were victors in the strife,<br />
Survives this saying on that chase,<br />
In memory of their famous race&mdash;<br />
"Here Hercules killed Hart-of-Grease,<br />
And Hart-of-Grease killed Hercules."<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "HART'S-HORN TREE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>I.&mdash;The memorable Westmorland Forest, or Park of Whinfell,
anciently written Qwynnefel, was a grant to Robert de
Veteripont from King John. This grant restrained him from
committing waste in the woods, and from suffering his servants
to hunt there in his absence during the king's life. Till the
beginning of last century it was famous for its prodigious oaks;
a trio of them, called The Three Brothers, were the giants of
the forest; and a part of the skeleton of one of them, called
<i>The Three Brothers' Tree</i>, which was thirteen yards in girth,
at a considerable distance from the root, was remaining until
within a very recent period.</p>

<p>On the east side of this park is Julian's Bower, famous for
its being the residence of Gillian, or Julian, the peerless mistress
of Roger de Clifford, about the beginning of the reign of
Edward III. The Pembroke memoirs call it "a little house
hard by Whinfell-park, the lower foundations of which standeth
still, though all the wall be down long since." This record
also mentions the Three Brother Tree and Julian's Bower, as
curiosities visited by strangers in the Countess of Pembroke's
time, prior to which a shooting seat had been erected near
these ruins, for she tells us, that her grandson, Mr. John
Tufton, and others at one time, "alighted on their way over
<i>Whinfield</i> park at Julian's Bower, to see all the rooms and
places about it." Its hall was spacious, wainscotted, and
hung round with prodigious stags' horns, and other trophies
of the field. One of the rooms was hung with very elegant
tapestry; but since it was converted into a farm-house all these
relics of ancient times have been destroyed.</p>

<p>A large portion of the park was divided into farms in
1767; and the remainder in 1801, when its deer were finally
destroyed. It was thus stripped of its giant trees, and consigned
to its present unsheltered condition.</p>

<p>II.&mdash;A fine oak formerly stood by the way side, near
Hornby Hall, about four miles from Penrith on the road to
Appleby, which, from a pair of stag's horns being hung up in
it, bore the name of Hart's-Horn Tree. It grew within the
district which to this day is called Whinfell Forest. Concerning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>this tree there is a tradition, confirmed by Anne,
Countess of Pembroke in her memoirs, that a hart was run by
a single greyhound (as the ancient deer hound was called) from
this place to Red-Kirk in Scotland, and back again. When
they came near this tree the hart leaped the park paling, but,
being worn out with fatigue, instantly died; and the dog,
equally exhausted, in attempting to clear it, fell backwards
and expired. In this situation they were found by the hunters,
the dog dead on one side of the paling, and the deer on the
other. In memory of this remarkable chase, the hart's horns
were nailed upon the tree, whence it obtained its name. And
as all extraordinary events were in those days recorded in
rhymes, we find the following popular one on this occasion,
from which we learn the name of the dog likewise:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
Hercules killed Hart-o-Grease,<br />
And Hart-o-Grease killed Hercules.<br />
</div>

<p>This story appears to have been literally true, as the Scots
preserve it without any variation, and add that it happened in
the year 1333 or 1334, when Edward Baliol King of Scotland
came to hunt with Robert de Clifford in his domains at
Appleby and Brougham, and stayed some time with him at
his castles in Westmorland. In course of time, it is stated,
the horns of the deer became grafted, as it were, upon the
tree, by reason of its bark growing over their root, and there
they remained more than three centuries, till, in the year 1648,
one of the branches was broken off by some of the army, and
ten years afterwards the remainder was secretly taken down
by some mischievous people in the night. "So now," says
Lady Anne Clifford in her Diary, "there is no part thereof
remaining, the tree itself being so decayed, and the bark so
peeled off, that it cannot last long; whereby we may see time
brings to forgetfulness many memorable things in this world,
be they ever so carefully preserved&mdash;for this tree, with the
hart's horn in it, was a thing of much note in these parts."</p>

<p>The tree itself has now disappeared; but Mr. Wordsworth,
"well remembered its imposing appearance as it stood, in a
decayed state by the side of the high road leading from Penrith
to Appleby."</p>

<p>This remarkable chase must have been upwards of eighty
miles, even supposing the deer to have taken the direct road.</p>

<p>Nicolson and Burn remark, when they tell the story, "So
say the Countess of Pembroke's Memoirs, and other historical
anecdotes. But from the improbable length of the course, we
would rather suppose, that they ran to Nine Kirks, that is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>the Church of Ninian the Scottish Saint, and back again,
which from some parts of the park might be far enough for
a greyhound to run." These writers have overlooked the
circumstance, that the animal which in those days was called
a greyhound was the ancient deerhound, a large species of
dog having the form of the modern greyhound, but with
shaggy hair and a more powerful frame. The breed is not
yet extinct: Sir Walter Scott's Maida was of the species.</p>

<p>Dr. Burn deals another blow at the tradition; for he goes
on to say, "And <i>before</i> this time there was a place in the
park denominated from the <i>Hart's horns</i>; which seem therefore
to have been put up on some former occasion, perhaps
for their remarkable largeness. For one of the bounder
marks of the partition aforesaid between the two daughters of
the last Robert de Veteripont is called <i>Hart-horn sike</i>".</p>

<p>III.&mdash;Dr. Percy, referring to the expression <i>hart-o-greece</i>
in a verse given below from the old ballad of "Adam Bell,"
explains it to mean a fat hart, from the French word <i>graisse</i>.</p>

<div class="poem">
"Then went they down into a lawnde,<br />
These noble archarrs thre;<br />
Eche of them slew a hart of greece,<br />
The best that they cold se."<br />
</div>

<p>Clarke, in an appendix to his "Survey of the Lakes,"
speaking of the Red Deer which is bred upon the tops of the
mountains in Martindale, gives <i>Hart of Grease</i> as the proper
name of the male in the eighth year.</p>

<p>In Black's "Picturesque Guide to the English Lakes," it is
stated in a note upon this subject, that there is an ancient
broadside proclamation of a Lord Mayor of London, preserved
in the Archiepiscopal Library at Lambeth, in which, after
denouncing "the excessyve and unreasonable pryses of all
kyndes of vytayles," it is ordered that "no citizen or freman
of the saide citie shall sell or cause to be solde," amongst
other things, "Capons of grece above <span class="smcap">XX</span>d. or Hennes of
grece above <span class="smcap">VII</span>d."</p></blockquote>

<h2>BEKAN'S GHYLL.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Dim shadows tread with elfin pace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The nightshade-skirted road,</span><br />
Where once the sons of Odin's race<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Bekan's vale abode;</span><br />
Where, long ere rose Saint Mary's pile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vanquish'd horsemen laid</span><br />
Their idol Wodin, stained and vile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the forest's shade.</span><br />
<br />
There hid&mdash;while clash of clubs and swords<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Resounded in the dell,</span><br />
To save it from the Briton's hordes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Odin's warriors fell&mdash;</span><br />
It lay with Bekan's mightiest charms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of magic on its breast;</span><br />
While Sorcery, with its hundred arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had sealed the vale in rest.</span><br />
<br />
It woke when fell with sturdy stroke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Norman axe around,</span><br />
And builders' hands in fragments broke<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Idol from the ground;</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><br />
And hewed therefrom that corner stone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which yet yon tower sustains,</span><br />
Where Wodin's Moth sits, grim and lone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And holds the dell in chains.</span><br />
<br />
There youth at love's sweet call oft glides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By cloister, aisle, and nave,</span><br />
To stop above the stone that hides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The beauteous Fleming's grave:&mdash;</span><br />
Fair flower of Aldingham&mdash;the child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of old Sir William's days,&mdash;</span><br />
Low where the Bekan straggling wild<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its deadly arms displays.</span><br />
<br />
There in the quiet more profound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Than sleep, than death more drear,</span><br />
Her shadow walks the silent ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When leaves are green or sere;</span><br />
When autumn with its cheerless sky<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or winter with its pall,</span><br />
Puts all the year's fair promise by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fruits that fade and fall.</span><br />
<br />
And where the Bekan by the rill<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So bitter once, now sweet,</span><br />
Its lurid purples ripens still<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While ages onward fleet,</span><br />
She tastes the deadly flower by night,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If yet its juices flow</span><br />
Sweet as of yore; for then to light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And rest her soul shall go.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span><br />
Ah, blessed forth from far beyond<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Jordan once he came,&mdash;</span><br />
Her Red-cross Knight,&mdash;the marriage bond<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To twine with love and fame:</span><br />
His meed of valour, Beauty's charms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pledged with one silvery word,</span><br />
Beneath the forest's branching arms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And by the breezes stirred.</span><br />
<br />
Another week! and she would stand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Urswick's halls a bride:</span><br />
Another week! the marriage band<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had round her life been tied:</span><br />
When wild with joyfulness of heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That beat not with a care,</span><br />
She carolled forth alone, to start<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The grim Moth from its lair.</span><br />
<br />
She bounded from his heart elate!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Urswick's halls of light,</span><br />
And Aldingham's embattled gate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No more shall meet her sight.</span><br />
For her no happy bridal crowd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Press out into the road,</span><br />
But Furness monks with dirges loud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bend round her last abode.</span><br />
<br />
To chase the moth that guards the flower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That makes the dell its own,</span><br />
Flew forth the maid from hall and tower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Through wood and glen alone.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><br />
Where Odin's men had left their god<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In earth, long overgrown</span><br />
With tangled bushes rude, she trod<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Enchanted ground unknown.</span><br />
<br />
The abbey walls before her gaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At distance rising fair,</span><br />
While deep within the magic maze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wandered unaware:</span><br />
She loitered with the song untired<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon her lips, nor thought</span><br />
What foes against her peace conspired,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While love his lost one sought!</span><br />
<br />
They found her with close-lidded eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Watched by that Moth unblest,</span><br />
Perched high between her and the skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And nightshade on her breast.</span><br />
There lay she with her lips apart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In peace; by Wodin's power</span><br />
Stilled into death her truest heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Bekan's lurid flower.</span><br />
<br />
Woe was it when Sir William's hall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Received the mournful train:</span><br />
No more her voice with sweetest call<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His morns to wake again!</span><br />
No more her merry step to cheer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The days when clouds were wild!</span><br />
No more her form on palfrey near<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When sport his noons beguiled!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><br />
Worse woe when Furness monks with dole&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While gentle hands conveyed</span><br />
Her body&mdash;for a parted soul<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The solemn ritual said;</span><br />
And laid her where the waving leaves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Breathed low amidst the calm,</span><br />
When loud upon the fading eves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rolled organ-chant and psalm.</span><br />
<br />
With Urswick's hand in fondest grasp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Said Fleming&mdash;"Vainly rise</span><br />
My days for me: my heart must clasp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her image, or it dies!</span><br />
Through mass and prayer I hear her voice;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I know the fiends have power&mdash;</span><br />
That chant and dole and choral noise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can purge not&mdash;o'er that flower!"</span><br />
<br />
They wandered where Engaddi's palms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Sharon's roses wave;</span><br />
Where Hebrew virgins chant their psalms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By many a mountain cave:</span><br />
Mid rock-hewn chambers by the Nile,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Magian fathers lay;&mdash;</span><br />
The secret of the spell-struck pile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To drag to realms of day.</span><br />
<br />
In vain! His gallant heart sleeps well,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the Lybian air;</span><br />
And still the enchantment holds the dell,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her so sweet and fair.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><br />
Still on yon loop hole stretched by night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The tyrant-moth is laid:</span><br />
While circling in their ceaseless flight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ages rise and fade.</span><br />
<br />
There sometimes as in nights of yore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heard faint and sweet, a sound</span><br />
Peals from yon tower, while o'er and o'e<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vale repeats it round.</span><br />
And down the glen the muffled tone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Floats slowly, long upborne;</span><br />
Answered as if far off were blown<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A warrior's bugle-horn.</span><br />
<br />
Yet one day, with unconscious art,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May some rude hand unfold</span><br />
Great Wodin's breast, and rend apart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fragment from its hold.</span><br />
Then, while the deadly nightshade's veins<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In bitter streams shall pour</span><br />
Their juices, his usurped domains<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall own the Moth no more.</span><br />
<br />
Then him a milk white swallow's power<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall timely overthrow.</span><br />
And fair, as from a beauteous bower,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In raiment like the snow,</span><br />
The Flower of Aldingham&mdash;the child<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of old Sir William's days&mdash;</span><br />
Shall break the bondage round her piled;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But not to meet his gaze.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><br />
Nor forth beneath the dewy dawn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All radiant like the morn,</span><br />
Shall Urswick's Knight lead up the lawn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside the scented thorn,</span><br />
His bride into the blighted halls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whence once she wildly strayed</span><br />
In ages past, by Furness walls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the Bekan played.</span><br />
<br />
The sea-snake through the chambers roves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of old Sir William's home&mdash;</span><br />
Fair Aldingham, its bowers, and groves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fields she loved to roam:</span><br />
And where the gallant Urswick graced<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His own ancestral board,</span><br />
Now ferns and wild weeds crowd the waste,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The creeping fox is lord.</span><br />
<br />
But gracious spirits of the light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall call a welcome down</span><br />
On her, the beauteous lady bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lead her to her own.</span><br />
Not to that home o'er which the tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unceasing heaves and rolls;</span><br />
But through that porch which opens wide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into the land of souls.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "BEKAN'S GHYLL."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>In the Chartulary of Furness Abbey, some rude Latin
verses, written by John Stell a monk, refer to a plant called
<i>Bekan</i>, which at some remote period grew in the valley in
great abundance, whence the name of Bekansghyll was
anciently derived. The etymology is thus metrically rendered:</p>

<p>
"Hæc vallis, tenuit olim sibi nomen ab herba<br />
Bekan, qua viruit; dulcis nunc tunc sed acerba,<br />
Inde domus nomen Bekanes-gill claruit ante."<br />
</p>

<p>This plant "whose juice is now sweet, but was then bitter,"
is assumed to be one of the species of Nightshade which are
indigenous in the dell and flourish there in great luxuriance;
probably the Solanum Dulcamara, the bitter-sweet or woody
nightshade, although the Atropa Belladonna, the deadly
nightshade, also grows among the ruins of the Abbey. This
"lurid offspring of Flora," as Mr. Beck calls it, the emblem
of sorcery and witchcraft, might well give the name of
Nightshade to that enchanting spot. But what authority the
monks may have had for their derivation it is now impossible
to ascertain. Various glossaries and lexicons are said to have
been consulted for <i>bekan</i>, as signifying the deadly nightshade
but without effect; "and after all," says Mr. Beck, "I am
inclined to believe that Beckansgill is a creation of the
monastic fancy."</p>

<p>Bekan is Scandinavian, and a proper name: and has
probably been localised in this district by the Northmen from
the period of its colonisation. It is said to have been quite in
accordance with the practice of these rovers to give the name of
their chiefs not only to the mounds in which they were buried,
but also in many cases to the valley or plain in which these
were situated, or in which was their place of residence; or
to those ghylls or small ravines, which, with the rivers or
brooks, were most frequently the boundaries of property.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Bekan's gill may be associated in some way with one of the
northern settlers whose name has thus far outlived his memory
in the district.</p>

<p>An interesting passage in Mr. Ferguson's "Northmen in
Cumberland and Westmorland" bears upon this subject. It
refers to the opening of an ancient barrow at a place called
Beacon Hill, near Aspatria in Cumberland, in 1790, by its
proprietor. Speaking of the barrow, Mr. Ferguson says:&mdash;
"From its name and its commanding situation has arisen the
very natural belief that this hill must have been the site of a
beacon. But there is no other evidence of this fact, and as
Bekan is a Scandinavian proper name found also in other
instances in the district, and as this was evidently a Scandinavian
grave, while the commanding nature of the situation
would be a point equally desired in the one case as the other,
there can hardly be a doubt that the place takes its name from
the mighty chief whose grave it was. On levelling the
artificial mound, which was about 90 feet in circumference at
the base, the workmen removed six feet of earth before they
came to the natural soil, three feet below which they found a
vault formed with two large round stones at each side, and
one at each end. In this lay the skeleton of a man measuring
seven feet from the head to the ankle bone&mdash;the feet having
decayed away. By his side lay a straight two-edged sword
corresponding with the gigantic proportions of its owner,
being about five feet in length, and having a guard elegantly
ornamented with inlaid silver flowers. The tomb also contained
a dagger, the hilt of which appeared to have been
studded with silver, a two-edged Danish battle-axe, part of a
gold brooch of semi-circular form, an ornament apparently of
a belt, part of a spur, and a bit shaped like a modern snaffle.
Fragments of a shield were also picked up, but in a state too
much decayed to admit of its shape being made out. Upon
the stones composing the sides of the vault were carved some
curious figures, which were probably magical runes. This
gigantic Northman, who must have stood about eight feet
high, was evidently, from his accoutrements, a person of considerable
importance."</p>

<p>The situation of Furness Abbey, in Bekan's Ghyll, justifies
the choice of its first settlers. The approach from the north
is such that the ruins are concealed by the windings of the
glen, and the groves of forest trees which cover the banks and
knolls with their varied foliage: but unluckily it has been
thought necessary to disturb the solitude of the place by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>driving a railway through it, within a few feet of the ruins,
and erecting a station upon the very site of the Abbot's
Lodge. A commodious road from Dalton enters this vale,
and crossing a small stream which glides along the side of
a fine meadow, branches into a shaded lane which leads
directly to the ruins of the sacred pile. The trees which
shade the bottom of the lane on one side, spread their bending
branches over an ancient Gothic arch, adorned with picturesque
appendages of ivy. This is the principal entrance into the
spacious enclosure which contains the Monastery. The building
appertaining to it took up the whole breadth of the vale;
and the rock from whence the stones were taken, in some
parts made place for and overtopped the edifice. Hence it
was so secreted, by the high grounds and eminences which
surround it, as not to be discovered at any distance. The
Western Tower must have originally been carried to a very
considerable height, if we judge from its remains, which
present a ponderous mass of walls, eleven feet in thickness,
and sixty feet in elevation. These walls have been additionally
strengthened with six staged buttresses, eight feet
broad, and projecting nine feet and a half from the face of the
wall; each stage of which has probably been ornamented
like the lower one now remaining, with a canopied niche and
pedestal. The interior of the tower, which measures twenty-four
feet by nineteen feet, has been lighted by a fine graceful
window of about thirty feet in height, by eleven and a half in
width; the arch of which must have been beautifully proportioned.
A series of grotesque heads, alternating with flowers,
is introduced in the hollow of the jambs, and the label
terminates in heads. On the right side of the window is a
loophole, admitting light to a winding staircase in the south-west
angle of the tower, by which its upper stories might be
ascended, the entrance to the stairs being by a door, having a
Tudor arch, placed in an angle of the interior. The stairs are
yet passable, and the view from the top is worth the trouble
of an ascent.</p>

<p>The workmen employed by the late Lord G. Cavendish,
state that the rubbish in this tower, accumulated by the fall
of the superstructure, which filled up the interior to the window
sill, was rendered so compact by its fall, so tenacious by the
rains, and was composed of such strongly cemented materials,
as to require blasting with gunpowder into manageable pieces
for its removal. Prior to its clearance, it was the scene of
some marvellous tales disseminated and credited by many, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>alleged that this heap covered a vault to which the staircase
led, containing the bells and treasure of the abbey, with the
usual accompaniments of the White Lady, at whose appearance
the lights were extinguished, the impenetrable iron-grated
door, and the grim guardian genius. Though many essayed,
none were known to have succeeded in the discovery of this
concealed treasure house, much less of its contents. The
inhabitants of the manor house, on one occasion, were roused
from their slumbers by a noise proceeding from the ruins, and
on hastening to the spot, discovered that it was made by some
scholars from the neighbouring town of Dalton, digging
among the ruins at midnight, in quest of the buried spoils.</p>

<p>Within the inner enclosure, on the north side of the Church
at St. Mary's Abbey in Furness, a few tombstones lie scattered
about in what has formerly been a part of the cemetery.
One of these bears the inscription, partly defaced,</p>

<div class="center">
HIC JACET ANA F.. ... ......TI FLANDREN...,<br />
</div>

<p>and commemorates one of the ancient family of Le Fleming.</p>

<p>Michael Le Fleming, the first of the name, called also
Flemengar, and in some old writings Flandrensis, was kinsman
to Baldwin, Earl of Flanders, father-in-law to the Conqueror;
by whom he was sent with some forces to assist William in
his enterprise against England.</p>

<p>After the Conquest was completed, and William was seated
on the throne of England, the valiant Sir Michael, for his
fidelity, and good services against the Saxons and Scots,
received from his master many noble estates in Lancashire;
Gleaston, and the manor of Aldingham, with other lands in
Furness. William de Meschines also granted him Beckermet
Castle, vulgarly at that time called Caernarvon Castle, with
the several contiguous manors of Frizington, Rottington,
Weddaker, and Arloghden, all in Cumberland.</p>

<p>Sir Michael and his heirs first settled at Aldingham. By a
singular accident, the time of which cannot now be ascertained,
the sea swallowed up their seat at this place, with the village,
leaving only the church at the east end of the town, and the
mote at the west end, which serve to show what the extent
of Aldingham has been. About the same time, it is supposed,
the villages of Crimilton and Ross, which the first Sir Michael
exchanged with the monks for Bardsea and Urswick, were
also swallowed up. After this, they fixed their residence at
Gleaston Castle; and it has been conjectured, from the nature
of the building, that the castle was built on the occasion, and
in such haste, as obliged them to substitute mud mortar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>instead of lime, in a site that abounds with limestone. Sir
Michael, is said, to have also resided at Beckermet.</p>

<p>The little knowledge that we are now able to gather of the first
Le Fleming exhibits him in a very favourable light. He was
undoubtedly a valiant man; and was acknowledged as such
by his renowned master, when, with other Norman chiefs, he
was dispatched into the north to oppose the Scots, and awe
the partisans of Edwin and Morcar, two powerful Saxons who
opposed themselves to the Conqueror for some time after the
nation had submitted itself to the Norman yoke, and whose
power William dreaded the most. His regard for the memory
of his sovereign he expressed in the name conferred upon his son
and heir, William. We have glimpses too that in his household
there was harmony and kindness between him and his
children. To the Abbey of Furness he was a great benefactor.
There is an affecting earnestness in the language with which
in the evening of his long life he declares in one of his
charters&mdash;"In the name of the Father, &amp;c. Be it known to
all men present and to come, That I, Michael Le Fleming,
consulting with God, and providing for the safety of my soul,
and the souls of my father and mother, wife and children, in the
year of our Lord 1153, give and grant to St. Mary of Furness,
to the abbot of that place, and to all the convent there serving
God, Fordeboc, with all its appurtenances, in perpetual alms;
which alms I give free from all claims of any one, with quiet
and free possession, as an oblation offered to God"&mdash;<i>saltim
vespertinum</i>, he pathetically adds, in allusion to his great age&mdash;"at
least an evening one." He adds, "signed by me with consent
of William my son and heir, and with the consent of all my
children. Signed by William my son, Gregory my grandson,
and Hugh." Few gifts of this kind show greater domestic
harmony. That Michael lived to a very advanced age is
evident from this charter signed eighty-seven years after the
Conquest; supposing him to be the same Michael Le Fleming
who came over with the Conqueror. He was buried with his
two sons within the walls of the Abbey Church. His arms,
a fret, strongly expressed in stone over the second chapel in
the northern aisle indicate the spot where he found a resting
place; not the least worthy among the many of the nobility
and gentry who in those days were interred within the sacred
precincts of St. Mary's Abbey in Furness.</p>

<p>The lands in Furness, belonging to Sir Michael, were
excepted in the foundation charter of Stephen to the Abbey.
This exception, and the circumstance of his living in Furness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>occasioned his lands to be called Michael's lands, to distinguish
them from the Abbey lands; and now they are called Muchlands,
from a corruption of the word Michael. In like manner
Urswick is called Much-Urswick for Michael's Urswick; and
what was originally called the manor of Aldingham, is now
called the manor of Muchland.</p>

<p>From Baldwin's kinsman, the first Le Fleming, the founder
of the family in England, two branches issued. William, the
eldest son of Sir Michael, inherited Aldingham Castle and his
Lancashire estates. His descendants, after carrying the name
for a few generations, passed with their manors into the
female line; and their blood mingling first with the de
Cancefields, and successively with the baronial families of
Harrington, de Bonville, and Grey, spent itself on the steps
of the throne in the person of Henry Grey, King Edward the
Sixth's Duke of Suffolk, who was beheaded by Queen Mary
on the 23rd of February 1554. This nobleman being father to
Lady Jane Grey, his too near alliance with the blood royal
gave the occasion, and his supposed ambition of being father
to a Queen of England was the cause of his violent death.
By his attainder the manors of Muchland, the possessions of
the le Flemings in Furness, were forfeited to the Crown.</p>

<p>Richard le Fleming, second son of the first Sir Michael,
having inherited the estates in Cumberland which William le
Meschines had granted to his father for his military services,
seated himself at Caernarvon Castle, Beckermet, in Copeland.
After two descents his posterity, having acquired by
marriage with the de Urswicks the manor of Coniston and other
considerable possessions in Furness, returned to reside in that
district. The Castle of Caernarvon was abandoned, then
erased, and Coniston Hall became the family seat for seven
descents. About the tenth year of Henry IV. Sir Thomas
le Fleming married Isabella, one of the four daughters and
co-heiresses of Sir John de Lancaster, and acquired with her
the lordship and manor of Rydal. The manor of Coniston
was settled upon the issue of this marriage; and for seven
generations more Rydal and Coniston vied with each other
which should hold the family seat, to fix it in Westmorland
or Lancashire. Sir Daniel le Fleming came, and gave his
decision against the latter, about the middle of the seventeenth
century. Since that event, the hall of Coniston, pleasantly
situated on the banks of the lake of that name, has been
deserted.</p>

<p>Singularly enough, the inheritance of this long line also has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>been broken in its passage through the house of Suffolk. Sir
Michael, the 23rd in succession from Richard, married, in the
latter part of the last century, Diana only child of Thomas
Howard, 14th Earl of Suffolk and Berkshire, by whom he
had one daughter, afterwards married to her cousin Daniel le
Fleming, who succeeded her father in the title. This marriage
being without issue, on the demise of Lady le Fleming,
the estates passed under her will to Andrew Huddleston of
Hutton-John, Esq., and at his decease, which occurred
shortly after, in succession to General Hughes, who assumed
the name of Fleming; both these gentlemen being near of kin
to the family at Rydal. The title descended to the brother of Sir
Daniel, the late Rev. Sir Richard le Fleming, Rector of Grasmere
and Windermere; and from him to his son, the present
Sir Michael, the twenty-sixth in succession from Richard, the
second son of Michael, Flandrensis, <i>the</i> Fleming, who came
over with the Conqueror, and founded the family in England.</p>

<p>In this family there have been since the Conquest twelve
knights and seven baronets.</p>

<p>The article <i>le</i> is sometimes omitted in the family writings
before the time of Edward IV., and again assumed. Sir
William Fleming, who died in 1756, restored the ancient
orthography, and incorporated the article <i>le</i> with the family
name at the baptism of his son and heir.</p>

<p>Rydal Hall suffered much from the parliamentary party:
the le Flemings remaining Catholic to the reign of James II.
For their adherence to the royal cause in the reign of Charles
I., they were forced to submit to the most exorbitant demands
of the Commissioners at Goldsmiths' Hall, in London (23
Car. <span class="smcap">1</span>) and pay a very great sum of money for their loyalty
and allegiance. They were very obnoxious to Oliver Cromwell's
sequestrators, and subjected to very high annual
payments and compositions, for their attachment to regal
government.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE CHIMES OF KIRK-SUNKEN.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Twelve sunken ships in Selker's Bay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rose up; and, righting soon,</span><br />
With mast and sail stretched far away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the midnight moon.</span><br />
<br />
They sailed right out to Bethlehem;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And soon they reached the shore.</span><br />
They steered right home from Bethlehem;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And these the freights they bore.</span><br />
<br />
The first one bore the frankincense;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The second bore the myrrh;</span><br />
The third the gifts and tribute pence<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Eastern Kings did bear.</span><br />
<br />
The fourth ship bore a little palm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meet for an infant's hands;</span><br />
The fifth the spikenard and the balm;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sixth the swathing bands.</span><br />

The seventh ship bore without a speck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A mantle fair and clean;</span><br />
The eighth the shepherds on her deck<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With heavenward eyes serene.</span><br />
<br />
One bore the announcing Angel's song;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One Simeon's glad record;</span><br />
And one the bright seraphic throng<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose tongues good tidings poured.</span><br />
<br />
And midst them all, one, favoured more,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whereon a couch was piled,</span><br />
The blessed Hebrew infant bore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On whom the Virgin smiled.</span><br />
<br />
They sailed right into Selker's Bay:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the night was worn</span><br />
To dawning grey, far down they lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Again that Christmas morn.</span><br />
<br />
But through the brushwood low and clear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came chimes and songs of glee,</span><br />
That Christmas morning, to my ear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath Kirk-sunken Tree.</span><br />
<br />
Not from the frosty air above,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But from the ground below,</span><br />
Sweet voices carolled songs of love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And merry bells did go.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "CHIMES OF KIRK-SUNKEN."</h3>

<p>In the parish of Bootle is a small inlet of the sea, called
Selker's Bay, where the neighbouring people say, that in calm

can be seen, which are traditionally stated to have been sunk
and left there on some great invasion of the northern parts of
this island, by the Romans, or the colonizing Northmen.</p>

<p>Various circles of standing stones, or what are generally
called Druidical remains, lie scattered about the vicinity of
Black Combe near the sea shore: several indicating by their
name the popular tradition associated with them, to which
the inhabitants around attach implicit credence, the spot
beneath which lie the ruins of a church that sank on a sudden,

Hence, they say, the name Kirk-Sank-ton, Kirk-Sunken,
Kirk-Sinking, and Sunken Kirks.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE RAVEN ON KERNAL CRAG.</h2>

<div class="poem">
A Raven alighted on Kernal Rock<br />
Amid thunder's roar and earthquake's shock.<br />
O'er the tumbling crags he rolled his eye<br />
Round valley and lake, and hills and sky.<br />
'Twas a gloomy world. He settled his head<br />
Close into his shoulders and meekly said&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"Poor Raven!"</span><br />
<br />
The Raven on Kernal Crag grew old:<br />
A human voice up the valley rolled.<br />
Bel was worshipp'd on mountain brows:<br />
Men made huts of the forest boughs:<br />
And wrapt in skins in ambush lay<br />
At the base of his crag, and seized their prey.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">An old Raven.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><br />
The Raven sat in his purple cloke.<br />
A Roman column the silence broke.<br />
He had watched the eagles around him fly:<br />
He saw them perched on spears go by.<br />
The legions marched from hill to hill.<br />
He settled his feathers; and all was still&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Still was the Raven.</span><br />
<br />
The Raven was thinking, on Kernal Stone.<br />
The hammers of Thor he heard them groan:<br />
Regin, and Korni, and Lodinn, and Bor,<br />
Clearing the forests from fell to shore;<br />
With Odin's bird on their banner upraised.<br />
And he quietly said as he downward gazed&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">"A Raven!"</span><br />
<br />
The Raven on Kernal was musing still.<br />
King Dunmail's hosts went up the hill,<br />
In the narrow Pass, to their final fall.<br />
With an iron gaze he followed them all;<br />
Till, piled the cairn of mighty stones,<br />
Was heaped the Raise o'er Dunmail's bones.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">Ha! hungry Raven!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><br />
The Raven on Kernal saw, in a trance,<br />
Knights with gorgeous banner and lance,<br />
Castles, and towers, and ladies fair.<br />
Music floating high on the air<br />
Reached his nest on Kernal's Steep,<br />
And broke the spell of his solemn sleep.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">A lonely Raven.</span><br />
<br />
That Raven is sitting on Kernal Rock;<br />
Counting the lambs in a mountain flock.<br />
Pleasant their bleat is, pleasant to hear,<br />
Pleasant to think of; but shepherds are near.<br />
Cattle are calling below in the vale,<br />
Maidens singing a true-love tale.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 10em;">List to them, Raven.</span><br />
<br />
That Raven will sit upon Kernal Rock<br />
Till the mountains reel in the world's last shock.<br />
Till the new things come to end like old,<br />
He will roll his eye, and his wings unfold,<br />
And settle again; and his solemn brow<br />
Draw close to his shoulders, and muse as now.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE RAVEN ON KERNAL CRAG."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Kernal Crag is a huge mass of solid rock, with a face of
broken precipice, on the side of Coniston Old Man. In that
unique and admirable Guide Book entitled "The Old Man;
or Ravings and Ramblings round Conistone," it is said; "on
this Crag, probably for ages, a pair of ravens have annually
had their nest, and though their young have again and again
been destroyed by the shepherds, they always return to this
favourite spot; and frequently when one of the parents has
been shot in the brooding season, the survivor has immediately
been provided with another helpmate; and, what is still more
extraordinary, and beautifully and literally illustrative of a
certain impressive scripture passage&mdash;it happened a year or
two since, that both the parent birds were shot, whilst the
nest was full of unfledged young, and their duties were immediately
undertaken by a couple of strange ravens, who attended
assiduously to the wants of the orphan brood, until they were
fit to forage for themselves."</p></blockquote>

His heart was stainless evermore!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
And thus the night was filled with moan.<br />
And was the good Earl slain and gone?<br />
For him the Prince that came in vain,<br />

By axe and block, on bended knee,<br />
For true-love, faith, and loyalty.<br />

And still, when o'er the Isles return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "LORD DERWENTWATER'S LIGHTS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Lord's Island, in Keswick Lake, is memorable as having
been the home of James Radcliffe, third and last Earl of
Derwentwater, whose life and great possessions were forfeited
in 1716, in the attempt to restore the royal line of Stuart to
the throne, and whose memory is affectionately cherished in
the north of England. An eminence upon its shores, called
Castle-Rigg, which overlooks the vale of Keswick, was formerly
occupied by a Roman fort, and afterwards by the
stronghold of the Norman lords, who were called, from the
locality of this their chief residence, de Derwentwater. Their
early history is wrapt in obscurity; but their inheritance
comprised the greater part of the parish of Crosthwaite, in
addition to possessions in other parts of Cumberland, and in
other counties. These became vested in the Radcliffe family
in the reign of Henry the Fifth, by the marriage of Margaret
daughter and heiress of Sir John de Derwentwater, with Sir
Nicholas Radcliffe, of lineage not less ancient than that of his
wife, he being of Saxon origin, and of a family which derived
its name from a village near Bury in Lancashire. In later
time the Norman tower on Castle-Rigg was abandoned, and
its materials are said to have been employed in building the
house upon that one of the three wooded islands in the lake,
which is called Lord's Island, and upon which the Radcliffe
family had a residence. This island was originally part of a
peninsula; but when the house was built, it was separated
from the main land by a ditch or moat, over which there was
a draw-bridge, and the approaches to this may still be seen.
Of the house itself, little more than the moss-covered foundations
remain. The stones, successively, of the Roman Castrum,
of the Norman Tower, and of the lord's residence, are said to
have been subsequently used in building the town-hall of
Keswick.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>The estate of the Derwentwater family seems to have
originally extended along the shores of the lake for nearly two
miles, and for a mile eastward of the shore. On one side of it lies
the present road from Keswick to Ambleside, on the other
its boundary approached Lodore, whilst the crest of Walla
Crag, divided it from the common. There, surrounded by a
combination of grandeur and beauty which is almost unrivalled
in this country, the Knightly ancestors of James Radcliffe, the
third and last Earl of Derwentwater, whose virtues and whose
fate have encircled his name with traditional veneration, had
their paternal seat.</p>

<p>This chivalrous and amiable young nobleman was closely
allied by blood to the Prince Edward, afterwards called "the
Pretender," in whose cause he fell a sacrifice; his mother, the
Lady Mary Tudor, a natural daughter of King Charles II.
and Mrs. Davis, being first cousin to the Prince. He was
nearly the same age as the Prince, being one year younger:
and in his early childhood was taken to France to be educated,
when James the Second and his consort were living in exile
at St. Germain's, surrounded, however, by the noble English,
Scottish, and Irish emigrant royalists, who followed the fortunes
of their dethroned monarch. The sympathies of his
parents having also led them thither, the youthful heir of
Derwentwater was brought up with the little Prince, at St.
Germain's, sharing his infantine pleasures and pastimes, and
occasionally joining his studies under his governess the
Countess of Powis. A friendship thus formed in youth,
nurtured by consanguinity, strengthened by ripening age, and
cemented by the extraordinary good qualities of the young
nobleman, and his power to win affection and esteem, culminated
in that attachment and devotion to the cause of his
Prince and friend, which terminated only with his life.</p>

<p>The Earl appears to have visited Dilston, his ancestral home
in Northumberland, for the first time in 1710, when he was
in his twenty-first year; and in the spring of the same year he
spent some time on the Isle of Derwent, where the ancient
mansion of the Radcliffes was then standing. During a considerable
portion of the two next succeeding years, his chief
residence appears to have been at Dilston, where he lived in
the constant exercise of hospitality, and in the practice of active
benevolence towards not only the peasantry on his wide
estates, but all who needed his assistance, whether known to
him or not, and whether Papist or Protestant. He seems to
have taken great delight in rural pursuits, and in the pleasures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>of the chase, and in the charms of nature by which he was
surrounded.</p>

<p>On the 10th of July 1712, when he had completed his 23rd
year, he espoused Anna Maria, eldest daughter of Sir John
Webb, of Canford, in the county of Dorset, Bart. His
acquaintance with this charming young lady began in the early
springtime of their lives, when both were receiving their
education in the French capital. The lady had been placed
in the convent of Ursuline Nuns in Paris for instruction: and
they had frequent opportunities of seeing each other at the
Chateau of St. Germain's, where the exiled monarch took
pleasure in being surrounded by the scions of his noble
English and Scottish adherents, who were then living at Paris.</p>

<p>On the rising of the adherents of the house of Stuart under
the Earl of Mar in August 1715, it was very well known to
the government, that the Earl's religion, his affections, and
sympathies, were all on the side of the exiled heir of that
family, and that his influence in the north of England was not
less than his constancy and devotion. A warrant was issued
for the apprehension of the Earl and his brother, the government
hoping by thus, as it were, gaining the move in the
game, to prevent the exercise of the Earl's influence against
King George. A friendly warning of the attentions which
were being paid to him at Whitehall reached the Earl in time;
and on hearing that the government messengers had arrived at
Durham, on their way to arrest him and his brother, they
withdrew from their home, and proceeded to the house of Sir
Marmaduke Constable, where they stayed some days. The
Earl afterwards took refuge in the home of a humble cottager
near Newbiggin House, where he lay hidden some time.
He remained in concealment through the latter part of
August, and the whole of September. During this time of
anxiety and surveillance, all the money, and even all the
jewels of the Countess, are said by local tradition to have
become exhausted: and to such straits was she reduced, that
a silver medal of Pope Clement XI. struck in the 14th year
of his Pontificate (1713), for want of money is said to have
been given by her, when encompassed by the Earl's enemies,
to a peasant girl, for selling poultry, or rendering some such
trifling service.</p>

<p>Early in October it was represented to the Earl that the
adherents of the exiled Prince were ready to appear in arms,
and to be only waiting for him and his brother to join them.
It would appear that at this critical moment, the Earl,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>influenced by many considerations, personal and domestic, as
well as prudential, wavered in his resolution; and tradition
avers that, on stealthily revisiting Dilston Hall, his Countess
reproached him for continuing to hide his head in hovels from
the light of day, when the gentry were in arms for their
rightful sovereign; and throwing down her fan before her
lord, told him in cruel raillery to take it, and give his sword
to her. Something of this feeling is attributed to her in the
old ballad poem entitled "Lord Derwentwater's Farewell,"
wherein the following lines are put into his mouth:&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Farewell, farewell, my lady dear:<br />
Ill, ill thou counselled'st me:<br />
I never more may see the babe<br />
That smiles upon thy knee."<br />
</p>

<p>The popular notion that the Earl was driven into his fatal
enterprise by the persuasions of his lady is evidently here
referred to. But the amiable and gentle character of the
Countess, that affectionate and devoted wife, whom the Earl
in his latest moments declared to be all tenderness and virtue,
and to have loved him constantly, is a sufficient refutation of
the popular opinion, which does so much injustice to her
memory. Nevertheless there is historical reason for believing
that the Earl did suddenly decide on joining the Prince's
friends, who were then in arms; and his lady's persuasions
may have contributed to that fatal precipitation. On the 6th
of October, the little force of horse and men, consisting of his
own domestic levy, was assembled in the courtyard of his
castle; arms were supplied to them; the Earl, his brother,
and the company, crossed the Devil's Water at Nunsburgh
Ford; and the fatal step was irrevocably taken. Old ladies
of the last century used to tell of occurrences of evil omen
which marked the departure of the devoted young nobleman
from the home of his fathers, to which he was destined never
to return; how on quitting the courtyard, his favourite dog
howled lamentably; how his horse, the well-known white or
dapple gray, associated with his figure in history and poetry,
became restive, and could with difficulty be urged forward;
and how he soon afterwards found that he had lost from his
finger a highly prized ring, the gift of his revered grandmother,
which he constantly wore.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to dwell upon the details of this unfortunate
and ill-conducted enterprise, in the course of which
James III. was proclaimed in town and village, in Warkworth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>and Alnwick, in Penrith and Appleby, Kendal and Lancaster,
to the final catastrophe of the little band at Preston. There,
hemmed in by the government troops, the brave and devoted
friends of the royal exiles, who had been led into this premature
effort contrary to their better judgments, and went forth
with a determined loyalty which good or bad report could not
subdue, saw reason to regret, when too late, their misplaced
confidence in their leaders. Already they saw themselves
about to be sacrificed to the divided counsels of their comrades
and the incapacity of Foster, their general. Defensive means
imperfectly planned, and hastily carried out, enabled them to
hold the approaches to the town for three or four days against
the Brunswickers, whom they gallantly repulsed, in a determined
attack upon their barricades. But overmatched by
disciplined troops; out-generalled, and out-numbered; and
finding resistance to be unavailing; on the morning of Monday
the 14th of October they surrendered at discretion to the forces
sent to oppose them. Being assembled in the market place
to the number of 1700, they delivered up their arms, and
became prisoners. The young Earl was sent to London,
which he reached on the 9th of December, and was conducted
to the Tower on the capital charge of high treason. Unavailing
efforts were made by his wife and friends to save him.
It appears that on the 20th of February his life was offered to
him by two noblemen who came to him in the tower, in the
name of the King, if he would acknowledge the title of
George I. and conform to the Protestant religion: but these
terms were refused by him. The offer of his life and fortune
was repeated on the scaffold, but he answered that the terms
"would be too dear a purchase." The means proposed to
him, he looked upon as "inconsistent with honour and conscience,
and therefore I rejected them." He went to the
block with firmness and composure: and his behaviour was
resolute and sedate. In an address which he delivered on the
scaffold, he said "If that Prince who now governs had
given me my life, I should have thought myself obliged never
more to have taken up arms against him." And the axe
closed, by a "violent and vengeful infliction," the brief
career of the beloved, devoted, and generous Earl of Derwentwater.
He was twenty-seven years of age.</p>

<p>Lady Derwentwater, who had been unceasing in her efforts
to save her husband, and solaced him in his confinement by
her society and tender care, after his death succeeded eventually
in having his last request in the Tower fulfilled. She had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>his body borne to its last resting place in the peaceful chapel
at Dilston to be interred with his ancestors. She made a
short sojourn at Dilston before leaving it for ever; and then
repaired with her little son and daughter to Canford, under the
roof of her parents.</p>

<p>Before leaving the North, the Countess visited the house
and estates at Derwentwater; and while there her life seems
to have been in some danger; for the rude peasantry of the
neighbourhood, to whom her southern birth and foreign
education, as well as the principles and attachments in which
she was brought up, were doubtless uncongenial, blamed her,
in the unreasoning vehemence of their grief, for the tragic fate
of their beloved lord and benefactor. Accordingly, not far
from the fall of Lodore, a hollow in the wild heights of Walla
Crag is pointed out by the name of Lady's Rake,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> in which
the noble widow is said to have escaped from their vengeance.
Her misfortunes needed not to be thus undeservedly augmented.
A more pleasing version of the story of her flight is, that the
Countess escaped through the Lady's Rake with the family
jewels, when the officers of the crown took possession of the
mansion on Lord's Island. No doubt this loving woman did
her utmost for the release of her lord. And this steep and
dangerous way has a human interest associated with it which
has given a special hold upon the hearts of the Keswick
people. In old times a large white stone in among the
boulders used to be pointed out as the Lady's Pockethandkerchief,
and that it still hung among the crags, where no one
could get at it.</p>

<p>In June, 1716, the Countess was living at Kensington Gravel
Pits, near London: whence she soon afterwards went to
Hatherhope; and subsequently made a brief sojourn under
the roof of her parents at Canford Manor; after which she
took up her residence at Louvaine. Here she died on the 30th
of August, 1723, at the early age of thirty; having survived
her noble husband little more than seven years; and was
interred there in the Church of the English regular Canonesses
of St. Augustine.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>The white or gray horse of the Earl is historical. Shortly
before the rising, and when he was in danger of apprehension,
the following short note was written by him:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="right">"Dilston, July 27th, 1715.</div>

<p>"Mr. Hunter,</p>

<p>"As I know nobody is more ready to serve a friend
than yourself, I desire the favour you will keep my gray horse
for me, till we see what will be done relating to horses. I
believe they will be troublesome, for it is said the D. of
Ormond is gone from his house. God send us peace and
good neighbourhood,&mdash;unknown blessings since I was born.
Pray ride my horse about the fields, or any where you think
he will not be known, and you will oblige, Sir, your humble
servant,</p>

<div class="right">"<span class="smcap">Derwentwater</span>."</div>

<p>"He is at grass."</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first sentence the reference is made to the jealous penal
regulation, which forbade a Roman Catholic to possess a noble
animal of height and qualities suited to military equipment.</p>

<p>From tradition preserved in the family of Mr. Hunter of
Medomsley, the person addressed, there is every reason to
believe that the gray horse mentioned in the above letter, was
the identical steed which was brought by the son of Mr.
Hunter to Bywell, and taken thence by Lord Derwentwater's
servant to Hexham for his lordship's use; and upon which
the devoted Earl rode from Hexham, with the gallant champions
of the Prince's right, on the 19th of October following.</p>

<p>A man named Cuthbert Swinburn, then 90 years of age,
who was born at Upper Dilston, and whose family resided
there for some generations, related to a correspondent of
W. S. Gibson, Esq., the author of Memoirs of the Earl of Derwentwater,
that he remembered the young Earl, and saw him
pass their house riding on a white horse, and accompanied by
several retainers, on the morning when he joined his neighbours
in the Prince's cause.</p>

<p>In a ballad relating to that fatal expedition it is said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Lord Derwentwater rode away<br />
Well mounted on his dapple gray."<br />
</div>

<p>And in the touching verses well known as "Derwentwater's
Farewell," his "own gray steed" is one of the earthly objects
of his regard to which he is supposed to bid adieu.</p>

<p>Of the house on Lord's Island, itself, only some low walls
now remain. A few relics of the mansion are preserved in
the neighbourhood. The ponderous lock and key of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
outer door, the former weighing eleven pounds, are preserved
in Crosthwaite's museum. The door itself, which was of oak
studded with knobs and rivets, was sold to a person named
Wilson, of Under Mozzer, a place thirteen miles from Keswick.
A bell, probably the dinner bell of the mansion, is in the town
hall of Keswick, and is of fine tone. A fine old carved chair
is preserved in the Radcliffe Room at Corby Castle, and
known as "My Lady's Chair." In Crosthwaite's museum is
preserved another ancient one of oak, which came from Lord
Derwentwater's house, and has the Radcliffe arms carved upon
it. And a stately and most elaborately carved oak bedstead
which belonged to Lord Derwentwater was purchased at the
sale of the contents of his house on Lord's Island, by an
ancestor of Mr. Wood, of Cockermouth, in whose family it
has remained, highly valued, ever since 1716.</p>

<p>Many articles of furniture, some family portraits, and other
property, that once belonged to Dilston Hall, still linger in
the vicinity of that place, where they are greatly treasured.</p>

<p>The Northumbrian and Cumbrian peasantry believed that
miraculous appearances marked the fatal day on which the
Earl of Derwentwater was beheaded. It was affirmed that the
"Divel's Water" acquired a crimson hue, as if his fair
domains were sprinkled with the blood of their gallant possessor;
and that at night the sky glowed ominously with
ensanguined streams. "The red streamers of the north" are
recorded to have been seen for the first time in that part of
England, on the night of the fatal 24th of February, 1716;
and in the meteor's fiery hue, the astonished spectators beheld
a dreadful omen of the vengeance of heaven. The phenomenon
has ever since been known as "Lord Derwentwater's
Lights." On the 18th of October, 1848, a magnificent and
very remarkable display of aurora borealis was witnessed in
the northern counties. The crimson streamers rose and
spread from the horizon in the form of an expanded fan, and
the peasantry in Cumberland and elsewhere said at the time,
that nothing like that display had been seen since the appearance
of "Lord Derwentwater's Lights," in February, 1716,
which may therefore be presumed to have been of a crimson
or rosy hue.</p></blockquote>

The shadow of their faded joy,<br />

Forth sped the youth: the valley closed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Behind him: adamantine hills,</span><br />
Like giants round the gates reposed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of his lost Eden, frowned; the rills</span><br />
With fainter murmurs far away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Died in the distance; and at length</span><br />

He came when mid the moving life<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Terror and the Plague went by.</span><br />
He walked where Panic fled the strife<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Strength with Death the Shadow nigh.</span><br />
The shaft that flew unseen by night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The deadly plague-breath, striking down</span><br />
Thousands on thousands in its flight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Made soon the widow's boy its own.</span><br />
<br />
Ah! woe for her! in that far vale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sorrow reached her; for there came</span><br />
Dread tidings and the mournful tale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dear relics and the fatal Name.</span><br />
All in the brightness of the noon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She bent above those relics dear;</span><br />
And ere the glimmering of the moon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Shadow from his side was near.</span><br />

It breathed into the farms; it smote<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The homesteads on the loneliest moor;</span><br />
And shuddering Nature cowered remote;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All fled the plague-struck widow's door.</span><br />
<br />
Alone, in all the vale profound:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Alone, on Lingmoor's mosses wide:</span><br />
Alone, with all the hills around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Langdale head to Loughrigg's side;</span><br />
Alone, beneath the cloud of night,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The morning's mist, the evening's ray;</span><br />
The hearthstone cold, and quenched its light;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Shadow wrestled with its prey.</span><br />
<br />
And day by day, while went and came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sunlight in the cheerless vale,</span><br />
Her hearth no more its wonted flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Renewed, the opening morns to hail:</span><br />
Glow'd not, though beating blasts and rain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drove in beneath her mournful eaves,</span><br />
Through Springs that brought the buds again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Autumns strew'd with fading leaves.</span><br />
<br />
No human foot its timorous falls<br />

The scene within those mouldering walls,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mystery in that lonely hold.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>Nor on that mountain side did morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or noon show how, or where, for rest</span><br />
That Earth to kindlier earth was borne&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The kinless to the kindred breast.</span><br />
<br />
Only the huntsman on the height,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The herdsman on the mountain way,</span><br />
Looked sometimes on the far-off site<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How desolate and lone it lay.</span><br />
Till when the years had rolled, their eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw wondering, where that home decay'd,</span><br />
A little plot of green arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Contiguous to the ruined shade.</span><br />
<br />
A little grove of half a score<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of laurels, intertwining round</span><br />
One nameless centre, blossomed o'er<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That homestead's desolated bound;</span><br />
And where their leaves hang green above&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A lowly circling fence of stone</span><br />
Sprang, reared by Powers that build to Love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When man, too weak, forsakes his own.</span><br />
<br />
And there where all lies wild and bare&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where mountains rise and waters flow,</span><br />
From Langdale's summits high in air,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To Brathay pools that sleep below&mdash;</span><br />
A green that never fades, one grove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of brightest laurels rears its boughs;</span><br />
While o'er that home's foundations rove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wild cats, and the asses browse.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><br />
There, if the song birds come, their notes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are hushed, that nowhere else are still:</span><br />
And when the winds pipe loud, and floats<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mist-cloud down from Dungeon-Ghyll,</span><br />
Again the cottage-eaves arise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within it, as of old, serene,&mdash;</span><br />
Its lights shine forth, its smoke up flies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And fades the grove of laurels green.</span><br />
<br />
But dimly falls the gleam of morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Around it; on the ferns the shade</span><br />
Of evening leaves a look forlorn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That elsewhere Nature has not laid.</span><br />
So, lonely on its height, so, drear,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It stands, while seasons wax and fail,</span><br />
Unchanged amid the changing year,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The voiceless mystery of the vale.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE LAURELS ON LINGMOOR."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>There seems to have been a long hereditary emulation
among the inhabitants of these districts to raise their sons
beyond the situation of their birth; a laudable practice, but
one which until recent times was clouded by a comparative
neglect of their daughters, whose education at the best was
very indifferent. Hence many of these youths have risen to
be respectable merchants, whose early circumstances compelled
them to toil for their daily bread, and to be educated in night
schools taught during the winter by a village schoolmaster, a
parish clerk, or some industrious mechanic. Dr. Todd states,
that in his time it was reported that Sir Richard Whittington,
knight, thrice Lord Mayor of London, was born of poor
parents in the parish of Great Salkeld, in East Cumberland;
that he built the church and tower from the foundation; and
that he intended to present three large bells to the parish,
which by some mischance stopped at Kirkby-Stephen on their
way to Salkeld. And a similar tradition is yet current in the
neighbourhood. Less apocryphal, perhaps, is the instance of
Richard Bateman, a native of the township of Staveley, near
Windermere; who, being a clever lad, was sent by the inhabitants
to London, and there by his diligence and industry
raised himself from a very humble situation in his master's
house to be a partner in his business, and amassed a considerable
fortune. For some years he resided at Leghorn; but his
end was tragical. It is said, that in his voyage to England,
the captain of the vessel in which he was sailing, poisoned him
and seized the ship and cargo. The pretty little Chapel of
Ings, in the vicinity where he was born, was erected at his
expense, and the slabs of marble with which it is floored were
sent by him from Leghorn. Hodgson states, that he gave
twelve pounds a year to the Chapel, and a thousand pounds
more to be applied in purchasing an estate, and building eight
cottages in the Chapelry for the use of its poor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>
<p>In Westmorland and Cumberland, thanks to the piety and
local attachments of our ancestors, endowed, or, as they are
more commonly called, free, schools abound. Grammar
schools were established on the verge of, and even within, the
lake district, prior to the dissolution of monasteries. From
these institutions a host of learned and valuable men were
distributed over England; many of them rose to great
eminence in the literary world; and contributed to the
establishment of Schools in the villages where they were born.
Before the conclusion of the 17th century, seminaries of this
kind were commenced in every parish, and in almost every
considerable village; and education to learned professions,
especially to the pulpit, continued the favourite method of the
yeomanry of bringing up their younger sons, till about the year
1760, when commerce became the high road to wealth, and
Greek and Latin began reluctantly, and by slow gradation, to
give way to an education consisting chiefly in reading, writing,
and arithmetic. Many of this new species of scholars were
annually taken into the employment of merchants and bankers
in London, and several of them into the Excise. The clergyman
generally found preferment at a distance from home,
where he settled and died; but the merchant brought his
riches and new manners and habits among his kindred.</p>

<p>The predilection for ancient literature and the learned professions
seems to have been a kind of instinctive propensity
among the people of these secluded vales. In the grammar
schools the discipline was severe, and the instruction imparted
was respectable. In addition to the endowment, the master's
industry was usually rewarded at Shrovetide with a gift in
money or provisions, proportioned to his desert, and the circumstances
of the donor. This present was called Cock-penny,
a name derived from the master being obliged by ancient usage
and the "barring-out" rules, to give the boys a prize to
fight cocks for; which cock-fighting was held either at
Shrovetide or Easter. Indeed this custom seems to have
originated in the care which was taken to instil into youth a
martial and enterprising spirit. This appears from the
founders, in many of the schools, having made half of the
master's salary to depend on the cock-pennies; and if the
master refused to give the customary prize, the scholars withheld
the present. The vacations were at Christmas and
Pentecost, for about a fortnight; and all red-letter days were
half-holidays. But between the former seasons the Barring-out
occurred; which consisted in the boys taking possession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>of the schoolroom early in the morning, and refusing the
master admittance until he had signed certain rules for the
regulation of the holidays, and a general pardon for all past
offences, demanding a bondsman to the instrument. Then
followed a feast and a day of idleness.</p>

<p>The youths of a neighbourhood, rich and poor, were all
educated together; a circumstance which diffused and kept
alive a plain familiarity of intercourse among all ranks of people,
which inspired the lowest with independence of sentiment,
and infused no insolent or unreal consequence into the wealthy.
Thus it was no unusual thing for the yeoman and the shepherd
to enliven their employments or festivities with recitations from
the bucolics of Virgil, the idyls of Theocrites, or the wars of
Troy. A story is told of the late Mr. John Gunson, a worthy
miller, who formerly kept the Plough Inn, a small public-house
near the Church at Ulpha. Two or three young fellows
from a neighbouring town, or, as some say, a party of students
from St. Bees School, being out on a holiday excursion,
called at John's, and after regaling themselves with his ale,
and indulging in a good deal of quizzing and banter at the
landlord's expense, demanded their bill. John in his homely
country dialect, said, "Nay, we niver mak' any bills here, ye
hev so much to pay"&mdash;mentioning the sum. "O," replied
one of the wags, "you cannot write: that is the cause of your
excuse." John, who had quietly suffered them to proceed
in their remarks, retired, and in a short time brought them in
a bill written out in the Hebrew language, which it need
scarcely be said quite puzzled them. He then sent them one
in Greek, and afterwards in Latin, neither of which they could
make out. They then begged that he would tell them in
plain English what they had to pay. John laughed heartily
at their ignorance, which on this occasion shone as conspicuous
as their impertinence to their learned and unassuming host.</p>

<p>If such was the level upon which the yeomanry stood in an
educational sense, their favourite plan of bringing up their
younger sons to the learned professions, and especially the
pulpit, may account for a saying which is almost proverbial
in Cumberland, "Owt 'll mak' a parson!" meaning thereby
that if one of their sons proved more stupid than another, the
church was the proper destination for him.</p>

<p>In the more secluded valleys the scholars were taught in the
church; the curate, who was also schoolmaster, sitting within
the communion rails, and using the table as a desk, while the
children occupied the pews or the open space beside him.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>In the parish register of the last named chapelry is a notice,
that a youth who had quitted the valley, and died in one of
the towns on the coast of Cumberland, had requested that his
body should be brought and interred at the foot of the pillar
by which he had been accustomed to sit while a school-boy.</p>

<p>Teachers of writing and arithmetic also wandered from
village to village, being remunerated by a whittle gate. The
churches and chapels have mostly a little school-house adjoining.
In some places the school-house was a sort of antichapel
to the place of worship, being under the same roof, an
arrangement which was abandoned as irreverent. It continues
however to this day in Borrowdale and some other chapelries.</p>

<p>Superstitious fears were sometimes entertained lest a boy
should <i>learn too far</i>. It was usual to consider all schoolmasters
as <i>wise men</i> or conjurors. Wise men were such as
had spent their lives in the pursuit of science, and had <i>learned
too much</i>. For conjuration was supposed to be a science
which as naturally followed other parts of learning as compound
addition followed simple addition. The wise man
possessed wonderful power. He could recover stolen goods,
either by fetching back the articles, showing the thief in a
black mirror, or making him walk round the cross on a market
day, with the stolen goods on his shoulders. The last, however,
he could not do, if the culprit wore a piece of <i>green sod</i>
upon his head. When any person applied to the wise man
for information, it was necessary for him to reach home before
midnight, as a storm was the certain consequence of the
application, and the applicant ran great risk of being tormented
by the devil all the way home. The wise men were
supposed to have made a compact with the devil, that he was
to serve them for a certain number of years, and then have
them, body and soul, after death. They were compelled to
give the devil some living animal whenever he called upon
them, as a pledge that they intended to give themselves at
last. Instances are recorded of boys, in the master's absence,
having got to his books, and raised the devil. The difficulty
was to lay him again. He must be kept employed, or have
one of the boys for the trouble given to him. The broken flag
through which he rose is no doubt shown to this day. Such
superstitions are not so completely exploded in the country,
but that many equally improbable tales are told and believed.</p>

<p>The old register-book of the parish of Penrith, which
appears to have been commenced about the year 1599, contains
some entries of an earlier date, which have been either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>copied from a former register, or inserted from memory. The
following entries occur:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Liber Registerii de Penrith scriptus in anno dni 1599 anno

and other places in Westmorland and Cumberland in the
year of our lord god 1598 of this plague there dyed at Kendal"&mdash;a
few words more, now very indistinct, follow, and the
remainder of the page is cut or torn off.</p>

<p>Several records of the ravages committed by the plague in
Cumberland and Westmorland are preserved in the more
populous parts. The following inscription on the wall in
Penrith Church is singular:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
AD MDXCVIII<br />
Ex gravi peste quæ regionibus hisce<br />

Carlisle 1196<br />
Posteri<br />
Avertite vos et vivite<br />
Ezek. 18th &mdash;&mdash; 32 &mdash;&mdash;<br />
</div>

<p>From the Register it appears that William Wallis was vicar
at the time; the following entries noting the beginning and
end of the calamity are interesting:&mdash;</p>

<p>"1597. 22d of September, Andrew Hodgson, a foreigner,
was buried."</p>

<p>"Here begonne the plague (God's punismet in Perith.)"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<p>"All those that are noted with the ltre P. dyed of the infection;
and those noted with F. were buried on the Fell."</p>

<p>"December 13th, 1598, Here ended the visitation."</p>

<p>The fear of infection prevented the continuance of the usual
markets; and places without the town were appointed for
purchasing the provisions brought by the country people.</p>

<p>The Church register in the neighbouring parish of Edenhall
takes notice of 42 persons dying in the same year, of the
plague, in that village.</p>

<p>Some centuries previous to this, in 1380, when the Scots
made an inroad into Cumberland, under the Earl of Douglas,
Penrith was suffering from a visitation of the same nature;
they surprised the place at the time of a fair, and returned
with immense booty; but they introduced into their country
the plague contracted in this town, which swept away one-third
of the inhabitants of Scotland.</p>

<p>It is not at all likely that these calamitous visitations were
confined to the towns and villages. Although few traces may
be found of this frightful disease having invaded the more remote
and scattered population of the dales. Records of
isolated cases might easily be lost in the course of ages; and,
as mere memorials of domestic affliction, were not likely to be
preserved in families. Yet tradition has its utterances where
purer history fails. On the side of Lingmoor in Great Langdale,
a small stone-fenced enclosure, a few feet across, of green
and shining laurels, indicates a spot which the pestilence had
reached. This bright circular patch of evergreens is very
conspicuous amid the ferns, from the heights on the opposite
side of the valley. On a near approach, the foundations of
what appear to be the remains of an ancient dwelling may be
traced at a little distance from it. Still more distant are the
ruins of one or two deserted cottages, where the sheep pasture
along the base of the mountain. What has been gathered
from the dalespeople about the laurels, so singular in such a
spot, is, that in the time of the great plague in England a
woman and her son occupied a cottage near the place. The
youth went from this remote district, in the spirit of enterprise,
to push his fortunes in London, was smitten by the pestilence,
and died. After a time some clothes and other things belonging
to him were sent to his home among the hills, infected the
mother, and spread terror throughout the neighbourhood.
The woman having fallen a victim to the disease, so great was
the dread of the pestilence that the ordinary rites of burial
could not be obtained for her. The body could not be borne
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>for interment in consecrated ground. It mouldered away, it
is supposed, on the spot which to this day is marked by the
little enclosure of evergreens, a memorial of the fearful visitation
in the lonely dale.</p>

<p>One of the most pleasing characteristics of manners in
secluded and thinly-peopled districts, is a sense of the degree
in which human happiness and comfort are dependent on the
contingency of neighbourhood. This is implied by a rhyming
adage common here, "<i>Friends are far, when neighbours are
nar</i>" (near). This mutual helpfulness is not confined to out-of-doors
work; but is ready upon all occasions. Formerly, if
a person became sick, especially the mistress of a family, it
was usual for those of the neighbours who were more particularly
connected with the party by amicable offices, to visit the
house, carrying a present; this practice, which is by no means
obsolete, is called <i>owning</i> the family, and is regarded as a
pledge of a disposition to be otherwise serviceable in a time of
disability and distress.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE VALE OF SAINT JOHN.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The morn was fresh; and ere we won<br />
The famous Valley of Saint John,<br />
For many a rood our thoughts had plann'd<br />
The scenery of that magic land.<br />
We pictured bowers where ladies fair<br />
Had breathed of old enchanted air;<br />
Groves where Sir Knights had uttered vows<br />
To Genii through the silvery boughs;<br />
Piles of the pride of ages gone<br />
Cleft between night and morning's sun,<br />
Or veiled by mighty Merlin's power;<br />
And her, too, Britain's peerless flower&mdash;<br />
Her, chained in slumbering beauty fast<br />
While generations rose and pass'd,<br />
Gyneth 'mid the Wizard's dens,<br />
King Arthur's child and Guendolen's!<br />
So, led by many a wandering gleam<br />
From youth and poetry's sweet dream,<br />
We climbed the old created hills,<br />
And cross'd the everlasting rills,<br />
Which lay between us and the unwon<br />
But glorious Valley of Saint John.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><br />
The morn was fresh, and bright the sun<br />
Burst o'er the drowsy mountains dun.<br />
A moment's pause for strength renewed,<br />
And we our pleasant march pursued.<br />
Blythely we scaled the steep, surpass'd<br />
By steeps each loftier than the last;<br />
O'er rocks and heaths and wilds we follow<br />
The vapoury path from height to hollow;<br />
And through the winding vale below,<br />
Where yellowing fields with plenty glow;<br />
And, scattered wide and far between,<br />
Lay white-walled farms and orchards green;<br />
The hedge-rows with their verdure crowned<br />
Hemming the little plots of ground;<br />
The happy kine for pastures lowing;<br />
The rivulets through the meadows flowing;<br />
The sunshine glittering on the slopes;<br />
The white lambs on the mountain tops;<br />
No vision and no gleam to call<br />
Enchantment from her airy hall;<br />
But beauty through all seasons won<br />
From Nature and her parent sun,<br />
There brightening as through ages gone,<br />
Lay round us as our hearts sped on<br />
To reach the Valley of Saint John.<br />
<br />
The noon was past; the sun's bright ray<br />
Sloped slowly down his westering way<br />
With mellower light; the sobering gleams<br />
Touched Glenderamakin's farthest streams;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>Flung all the richness of their charms<br />
Round lonely Threlkeld's wastes and farms:<br />
And high beyond fired with their glow<br />
Blencathra's steep and lofty brow;<br />
When suddenly&mdash;as if by power<br />
Of Magic wrought in that bright hour&mdash;<br />
Shone out, with all the circumstance<br />
And splendour of restored Romance,<br />
Southwards afar behind us spread,<br />
With its grey fortress at its head,<br />
The Valley, spell-bound as of old,<br />
In all its mingling green and gold;<br />
In all the glory of the time<br />
When Uther's son was in his prime,<br />
And chivalry ranged every clime;<br />
And peaceful as when Gyneth, kept<br />
In Merlin's halls, beneath it slept.<br />
There had we roamed the live-long day<br />
Saint John's fair fields and winding way,<br />
With hearts unconsciously beguiled<br />
By witcheries and enchantment wild!<br />
And not till steps that toiled no more<br />
It's utmost bound had vanish'd o'er,<br />
Knew youth's wild thought our hearts had won,<br />
And thrid the Valley of Saint John.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE VALE OF SAINT JOHN."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Near the village of Threlkeld, the road from Keswick to
Penrith, branching off on the right, discloses obliquely to the
view, the Vale of St. John. The well known description of
this beautiful dell by Mr. Hutchinson, who visited it in the
year 1773, conferred upon it a reputation which was greatly
increased when the genius of Scott made it the scene of his
tale of enchantment "The Bridal of Triermain." The interest
which it derives from its traditional connection with the wiles
of Merlin, whose magic fortress continues to attract and elude
the gaze of the traveller, is well given in the words of the
former writer.</p>

<p>"We now gained a view of the Vale of St. John's, a very
narrow dell, hemmed in by mountains, through which a small
brook makes many meanderings, washing little enclosures of
grass ground, which stretch up the risings of the hills. In the
widest part of the dale you are struck with the appearance of
an ancient ruined castle, which seems to stand upon the summit
of a little mount, the mountains around forming an amphitheatre.
This massive bulwark shews a front of various
towers, and makes an awful, rude, and Gothic appearance,
with its lofty turrets and rugged battlements: we traced the
galleries, the bending arches, the buttresses. The greatest
antiquity stands characterized in its architecture; the inhabitants
near it assert it is an antidiluvian structure.</p>

<p>"The traveller's curiosity is roused, and he prepares to
make a nearer approach, when that curiosity is put upon the
rack, by his being assured that, if he advances, certain genii,
who govern the place, by virtue of their supernatural arts and
necromancy will strip it of all its beauties, and by enchantment
transform the magic walls. The vale seems adapted for the
habitation of such beings; its gloomy recesses and retirements
look like the haunts of evil spirits. There was no delusion in
the report; we were soon convinced of its truth; for this piece
of antiquity, so venerable and noble in its aspect, as we drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>near, changed its figure, and proved no other than a shaken
massive pile of rocks, which stand in the midst of this little
vale, disunited from the adjoining mountains, and have so
much the real form and resemblance of a castle, that they bear
the name of <i>The Castle Rocks of St. John's</i>."</p>

<p>The more familiar appellation of this rocky pile among the
dalesmen is <i>Green Crag</i>. The approach into the valley from
Threlkeld displays it in the most poetical point of view, and
under some states of atmosphere it requires no stretch of the
imagination to transform its grey perpendicular masses into an
impregnable castle, whose walls and turrets waving with ivy
and other parasitical plants, form the prison of the immortal
Merlin.</p>

<p>Other atmospheric effects, which occasionally occur in this
District, have been alluded to elsewhere in these notes; as the
aerial armies seen on Souter Fell, and the Helm Cloud and
Bar, with their accompanying wind, generated upon Cross
Fell.</p>

<p>Phenomena of a singular character, which may be ascribed
to reflections from pure and still water in the lakes, have also
attracted observation. Mr. Wordsworth has described two of
which he was an eye-witness. "Walking by the side of
Ulswater," says he, "upon a calm September morning, I saw
deep within the bosom of the lake, a magnificent Castle, with
towers and battlements; nothing could be more distinct than
the whole edifice;&mdash;after gazing with delight upon it for some
time, as upon a work of enchantment, I could not but regret
that my previous knowledge of the place enabled me to
account for the appearance. It was in fact the reflection of a
pleasure house called Lyulph's Tower&mdash;the towers and battlements
magnified and so much changed in shape as not to be
immediately recognised. In the meanwhile, the pleasure
house itself was altogether hidden from my view by a body of
vapour stretching over it and along the hill-side on which it
extends, but not so as to have intercepted its communication
with the lake; and hence this novel and most impressive
object, which, if I had been a stranger to the spot, would,
from its being inexplicable, have long detained the mind in a
state of pleasing astonishment. Appearances of this kind,
acting upon the credulity of early ages, may have given birth
to, and favoured the belief in, stories of sub-aqueous palaces,
gardens, and pleasure-grounds&mdash;the brilliant ornaments of
Romance.</p>

<p>"With this inverted scene," he continues, "I will couple a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>much more extraordinary phenomenon, which will shew how
other elegant fancies may have had their origin, less in invention
than in the actual process of nature.</p>

<p>"About eleven o'clock on the forenoon of a winter's day,
coming suddenly, in company of a friend, into view of the
Lake of Grasmere, we were alarmed by the sight of a newly
created Island; the transitory thought of the moment was,
that it had been produced by an earthquake or some convulsion
of nature. Recovering from the alarm, which was
greater than the reader can possibly sympathize with, but
which was shared to its full extent by my companion, we
proceeded to examine the object before us. The elevation of
this new island exceeded considerably that of the old one, its
neighbour; it was likewise larger in circumference, comprehending
a space of about five acres; its surface rocky,
speckled with snow, and sprinkled over with birch trees; it
was divided towards the south from the other island by a
firth, and in like manner from the northern shore of the lake;
on the east and west it was separated from the shore by a
much larger space of smooth water.</p>

<p>"Marvellous was the illusion! comparing the new with the
old Island, the surface of which is soft, green, and unvaried,
I do not scruple to say that, as an object of sight, it was much
the more distinct. 'How little faith,' we exclaimed, 'is due
to one sense, unless its evidence be confirmed by some of its
fellows! What stranger could possibly be persuaded that this,
which we know to be an unsubstantial mockery, is <i>really</i> so;
and that there exists only a single Island on this beautiful
Lake?' At length the appearance underwent a gradual
transmutation; it lost its prominence and passed into a
glimmering and dim <i>inversion</i>, and then totally disappeared;&mdash;leaving
behind it a clear open area of ice of the same dimensions.
We now perceived that this bed of ice, which was
thinly suffused with water, had produced the illusion, by
reflecting and refracting (as persons skilled in optics would no
doubt easily explain,) a rocky and woody section of the
opposite mountain named Silver-how."</p>

<p>Southey describes a scene that he had witnessed on Derwent
Lake, as "a sight more dreamy and wonderful than any
scenery that fancy ever yet devised for Faery-land. We had
walked down," he writes, "to the lake side, it was a delightful
day, the sun shining, and a few white clouds hanging motionless
in the sky. The opposite shore of Derwentwater consists
of one long mountain, which suddenly terminates in an arch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>thus [arch symbol], and through that opening you see a long valley
between mountains, and bounded by mountain beyond mountain;
to the right of the arch the heights are more varied and
of greater elevation. Now, as there was not a breath of air
stirring, the surface of the lake was so perfectly still, that it
became one great mirror, and all its waters disappeared; the
whole line of shore was represented as vividly and steadily as
it existed in its actual being&mdash;the arch, the vale within, the
single houses far within the vale, the smoke from the chimneys,
the farthest hills, and the shadow and substance joined at their
bases so indivisibly, that you could make no separation even
in your judgment. As I stood on the shore, heaven and the
clouds seemed lying under me; I was looking down into the
sky, and the whole range of mountains, having the line of
summits under my feet, and another above me, seemed to be
suspended between the firmaments. Shut your eyes and dream
of a scene so unnatural and so beautiful. What I have said is
most strictly and scrupulously true; but it was one of those
happy moments that can seldom occur, for the least breath
stirring would have shaken the whole vision, and at once
unrealised it. I have before seen a partial appearance, but
never before did, and perhaps never again may, lose sight of
the lake entirely; for it literally seemed like an abyss of sky
before me, not fog and clouds from a mountain, but the blue
heaven spotted with a few fleecy pillows of cloud, that looked
placed there for angels to rest upon them."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE LUCK OF EDENHALL.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The martial Musgraves sheathed the sword,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And held in peace sweet Edenhall.</span><br />
For never that house or that house's lord<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May evil luck or mischance befal,</span><br />
While their crystal chalice can soundly ring,<br />
Or sparkle brim-full at St. Cuthbert's spring.<br />
<br />
Rude warlike men were the race of old:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And seldom with priest of holy rood</span><br />
Or penance discoursed their knights so bold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who won them the Forest of Inglewood.</span><br />
For better lov'd they to grasp the spear,<br />
Than beads to count or masses to hear.<br />
<br />
There came a bright Lady from over the sea,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once to look on their youthful heir.</span><br />
Saintly and like a spirit was she;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sweetest words did her tongue declare;</span><br />
When filling a beautiful glass to the brim<br />
At St. Cuthbert's Well, she gave it to him.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span><br />
Radiant and rare&mdash;from her garment's hem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To her shining forehead, all dazzling o'er,</span><br />
As of crystal and gold and enamel the gem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of sparkling light from the fount she bore&mdash;</span><br />
Her snow-white fingers unringed she spread<br />
On the gallant young Musgrave's lordly head.<br />
<br />
With his ruby lips he touch'd the glass,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And quaff'd off the crystal draught within.</span><br />
"From thee and from thine if ever shall pass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The pledge of this hour, shall their doom begin.</span><br />
Whenever that cup shall break or fall,<br />
Farewell the luck of Edenhall!"<br />
<br />
While marvelling much at so fair a sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wooing a vision so sweet to stay,</span><br />
Like a vanishing dream of the closing night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within the dark Forest she pass'd away;</span><br />
And left him musing, with senses dim,<br />
On the gifts the bright chalice had brought to him.<br />
<br />
He clasped it close, and he turn'd it o'er;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within and without its form survey'd;</span><br />
Till the deeds and thoughts of his sires of yore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seem'd to him like rust on a goodly blade.</span><br />
And the more the glass in his hands he turned,<br />
The more for a nobler life he yearned.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><br />
And there on the verge of the Forest, where stood<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Hall for ages, he vow'd to be</span><br />
The servant of Him who died on the Rood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lay in the Tomb of Arimathee;</span><br />
And to drink of that cup at the Holy Well.<br />
So wrought within him the Lady's spell.<br />
<br />
And down the twilight came on his thought;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sleep fell on him beneath the trees;</span><br />
When an errand for water the butler brought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the spot, where around the slumberer's knees</span><br />
The envious fairies, a glittering band,<br />
Were loosing the cup from his slackening hand.<br />
<br />
He scared them forth: and in fierce despite<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They mocked, and mowed, and sang in his ear,&mdash;</span><br />
"See you yon horsemen along the height?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They had harried the Hall had'st thou not come near.</span><br />
Whenever that cup shall break or fall,<br />
Farewell the luck of Edenhall."<br />
<br />
And the martial lords of Edenhall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They kept their cup with enamel and gold</span><br />
Where never the goblet could break or fall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or fail its measure of luck to hold;</span><br />
That birth or bridal, beneath its sway,<br />
Might never befal on an evil day;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><br />
And land and lordship stretching wide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And honour and worship might still be theirs;</span><br />
As long as that cup, preserved with pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should be honoured and prized by Musgrave's heirs:</span><br />
The goblet the Lady from over the wave<br />
To their sire in the Forest of Inglewood gave.<br />
<br />
It has sparkled high o'er the cradled babe:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It has pledged the bride on her nuptial day:</span><br />
It has bless'd their lips at life's last ebb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With its sacred juice to cleanse the clay.</span><br />
For the touch the bright Lady left on its brim<br />
Can give light to the soul when all else is dim.<br />
<br />
Long prosper the luck of that noble line.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May never the Musgrave's name decay.</span><br />
And to crown their board, when the goblets shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May the crystal chalice be found alway!</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE LUCK OF EDENHALL."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The curious ancient drinking glass, called the Luck of
Edenhall, on the preservation of which, according to popular
superstition, the prosperity of the Musgrave family depends,
is well known from the humourous parody on the old ballad
of Chevy Chase, commonly attributed to the Duke of Wharton,
but in reality composed by Lloyd, one of his jovial companions,
which begins,</p>

<div class="poem">
"God prosper long from being broke<br />
The Luck of Edenhall."<br />
</div>

<p>The Duke, after taking a draught, had nearly terminated
"the Luck of Edenhall;" but fortunately the butler caught
the cup in a napkin as it dropped from his grace's hands. It
is understood that it is no longer subjected to such risks. It
is now generally shown with a damask cloth securely held by
the four corners beneath it, which for this purpose is deposited
along with the vessel in a safe place where important family
documents are preserved.</p>

<p>Not without good reason do the Musgraves look with superstitious
regard to its careful preservation amongst them. The
present generation could, it is said, tell of disasters following
swift and sure upon its fall, in fulfilment of the omen embodied
in the legend attached to it.</p>

<p>The vessel is of a green coloured glass of Venice manufacture
of the 10th century, ornamented with foliage of different
colours in enamel and gold; it is about seven inches in height
and about two in diameter at the base, from which it increases
in width and terminates in a gradual curve at the brim where
it measures about four inches. It is carefully preserved in a
stamped leather case, ornamented with scrolls of vine leaves,
and having on the top, in old English characters, the letters
I. H. C.; from which it seems probable that this vessel was
originally designed for sacred uses. The covering is said to
be of the time of Henry VI. or Edward IV. The glass is
probably one of the oldest in England.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>The tradition respecting this vessel is connected with the
still current belief, that he who has courage to rush upon a
fairy festival, and snatch from them their drinking cup or horn,
shall find it prove to him a cornucopia of good fortune or
plenty, if he can bear it safely across a running stream. The
goblet still carefully preserved in Edenhall is supposed to have
been seized at a banquet of the elves, by one of the ancient
family of Musgrave; or, as others say, the butler, going to
fetch water from St. Cuthbert's Well, which is near the hall,
surprised a company of fairies who were dancing on the green,
near the spring, where they had left this vessel, which the
butler seized, and on his refusal to restore it, they uttered the
ominous words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Whenever this cup shall break or fall,<br />
Farewell the luck of Edenhall."<br />
</div>

<p>The name of the goblet was taken from the prophecy. There
is no writing to shew how it came into the family, nor any
record concerning it. Its history rests solely on the tradition.
Dr. Todd supposes it to have been a chalice, when it was
unsafe to have those sacred vessels made of costlier metals, on
account of the predatory habits which prevailed on the borders.
He also says, that the bishops of this diocese permitted not
only the parochial or secular, but also the monastic or
regular clergy, to celebrate the eucharist in chalices of that
clear and transparent metal. The following was one of the
canons made in the reign of king Athelstan:&mdash;<i>Sacer calix
fusilis sit, non ligneus</i>&mdash;<i>Let the holy chalice be fusile, and not of
wood, which might imbibe the consecrated wine.</i></p>

<p>William of Newbridge relates how one of these drinking-vessels,
called elfin goblets, came into the possession of King
Henry the First. A country-man belonging to a village near
his own birthplace, returning home late at night, and tipsy,
from a visit to a friend in a neighbouring village, heard a
sound of merriment and singing within a hill; and peeping
through an open door in the side of the hill, he saw a numerous
company of both sexes feasting in a large and finely lighted
hall. A cup being handed to him by one of the attendants,
he took it, threw out the contents, and made off with his booty,
pursued by the whole party of revellers, from whom he
escaped by the speed of his mare, and reached his home in
safety. The cup, which was of unknown material and of
unusual form and colour was presented to the king.</p>

<p>At Muncaster Castle there is preserved an ancient glass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>vessel of the basin form, about seven inches in diameter,
ornamented with some white enamelled mouldings; which,
according to family tradition, was presented by King Henry
VI. to Sir John Pennington, Knight, who was steadily attached
to that unfortunate monarch, and whom he had the honour of
entertaining at Muncaster Castle, in his flight from the
Yorkists. In acknowledgment of the protection he had
received, the King is said to have presented his host with this
curious glass cup with a prayer that the family should ever
prosper, and never want a male heir, so long as they preserved
it unbroken: hence the cup was called "the luck of Muncaster."
The Hall contains, among other family pictures,
one representing "King Henry VI. giving to Sir John
Pennington, on his leaving the Castle 1461, the luck of
Muncaster."</p>

<p>It is probable that the king was here on two occasions; the
first being after the battle of Towton, in 1461, when accompanied
by his queen and their young son, with the dukes of
Exeter and Somerset, he fled with great precipitation into
Scotland: the second, after the battle of Hexham, which was
fought on the 15th of May, 1463. On his defeat at Hexham,
some friends of the fugitive king took him under their protection,
and conveyed him into Lancashire. During the
period that he remained in concealment, which was about
twelve months, the king visited Muncaster. On this occasion
the royal visit appears to have been attended with very little
of regal pomp or ceremony. Henry, having made his way
into Cumberland, with only one companion arrived at Irton
Hall soon after midnight; but his quality being unknown, or
the inmates afraid to receive him, he was denied admittance.
He then passed over the mountains towards Muncaster, where
he was accidentally met by some shepherds at three o'clock in
the morning, and was conducted by them to Muncaster Castle.
The spot where the meeting took place is still indicated
by a tall steeple-like monument on an eminence at some
distance from the castle.</p>

<p>The "luck of Burrell Green," at the house of Mr. Lamb,
yeoman, in Great Salkeld, Cumberland, is less fragile in
structure, is not less venerated for its traditional alliance with
the fortunes of its possessors than the lordly cups of the Penningtons
and Musgraves. It is an <i>ancient</i> brass dish resembling
a shield, with an inscription round it, now nearly effaced.
Like the celebrated glass of Edenhall, this too has its legend
and couplet, the latter of which runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
"If this dish be sold or gi'en,<br />
Farewell the luck of Burrell Green."<br />
</div>

<p>When Ranulph de Meschines had received the grant of
Cumberland from William the Conqueror, he made a survey
of the whole county, and gave to his followers all the frontiers
bordering on Scotland and Northumberland, retaining to himself
the central part between the east and west mountains, "a
goodly great forest, full of woods, red deer and fallow, wild
swine, and all manner of wild beasts." This Forest of Inglewood
comprehends all that large and now fertile tract of
country, extending westward from Carlisle to Westward,
thence in a direct line through Castle Sowerby and Penrith to
the confluence of the Eamont and the Eden, which latter river
then forms its eastern boundary all the way northward to Carlisle,
forming a sort of triangle, each side of which is more
than twenty miles in length. The Duke of Devonshire, as
lord of the Honour of Penrith, has now paramount authority
over the manors of Inglewood Forest.</p>

<p>The Forest, or Swainmote, court, for the seigniory, is held
yearly, on the feast of St. Barnabas the apostle (June 11.) in
the parish of Hesket-in-the-Forest, in the open air, on the
great north road to Carlisle; and the place is marked by a
stone placed before an ancient thorn, called <i>Court-Thorn</i>.
The tenants of more than twenty mesne manors attend here,
from whom a jury for the whole district is empanelled and
sworn; and Dr. Todd says, that the chamberlain of Carlisle
was anciently foreman. Here are paid the annual dues to the
lord of the forest, compositions for improvements, purprestures,
agistments, and puture of the foresters.</p>

<p>Until the year 1823, there was an old oak on Wragmire
Moss, well known as <i>the last tree of Inglewood Forest</i>, which
had survived the blasts of 700 or 800 winters. This "time-honored"
oak was remarkable, not only for the beauty of the
wood, which was marked in a similar manner to satin-wood,
but as being a boundary mark between the manors of the
Duke of Devonshire and the Dean and Chapter of Carlisle, as
also between the parishes of Hesket and St. Cuthbert's, Carlisle;
and was noticed as such for upwards of 600 years.
This oak, which had weathered so many hundred stormy
winters was become considerably decayed in its trunk. It fell
not, however, by the tempest or the axe, but from sheer old
age on the 13th of June, 1823. It was an object of great
interest, being the veritable last tree of Inglewood Forest:
under whose spreading branches may have reposed victorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>Edward I., who is said to have killed 200 bucks in this ancient
forest; and, perhaps at a later period, "John de Corbrig, the
poor hermit of Wragmire," has counted his beads beneath its
shade.</p>

<p>On the same day on which this tree fell, Mr. Robert Bowman,
who was born at Hayton, in 1705, died at Irthington, at
the extraordinary age of 117 years and 8 months, retaining his
faculties till about three months before his death. He lived
very abstemiously, was never intoxicated but once in his life,
and at the age of 111, used occasionally to assist his family at
their harvest work. The last forty years of his life were spent
at Irthington, and in his 109th year he walked to and from
Carlisle, being 14 miles, in one day.</p>

<p>The most remarkable instance of longevity in a native of
Cumberland is that of John Taylor, born at Garragill in the
parish of Aldston moor. He went underground to work in the
lead mines at eleven years of age. He was fourteen or fifteen
at the time of the great solar eclipse, called in the North <i>mirk
Monday</i>, which happened 29th of March, 1652. From that
time till 1752, except for two years, during which he was
employed in the mint at Edinburgh, he wrought in the mines
at Aldston, at Blackhall in the Bishoprick of Durham, and in
various parts of Scotland. His death happened sometime in
the year 1772, in the neighbourhood of Moffat, near the Leadhills
mines, in which he had been employed several years.
He worked in the mines till he was about 115. At the time
of his decease he must have been 135 years of age.</p>

<p>The Rev. George Braithwaite, who died, curate of St.
Mary's Carlisle, in 1753, at the age of 110, is said to have
been a member of the Cathedral, upwards of one hundred
years, having first become connected with the establishment
as a chorister.</p>

<p>In Cumberland the prevalence of longevity seems to be confined
to no particular district: the parishes which border on
the fells on the east side of the county, are rather more
remarkable for longevity than those on the Western coast:
but there is little difference except in the large towns.</p>

<p>A list of remarkable instances of longevity, chiefly taken
from the registers of burials in the several parishes in Cumberland,
is given in Lyson's Magna Britannia. It embraces the
period between 1664 and 1814 inclusive, and gives the date,
name, parish, and age of each individual. In that space of
150 years, the list comprises 144 individuals ranging from 100
to 113 years of age. Seventy were males, seventy-four were
females.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>
<p>The number of persons in Cumberland who have reached
from 90 to 99 years inclusive, since the ages have been noted
in the parish registers is above 1120: of these about one fourth
have attained or exceeded the age of 95 years.</p></blockquote>

<h2>HOB-THROSS.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Millom's bold lords and knights of old<br />
Quaff'd their mead from cups of gold.<br />
A lordly life was theirs, and free,<br />
With revel and joust and minstrelsy.<br />
Their fields were full, and their waters flow'd;<br />
On a hundred steeds their warriors rode:<br />
And glorious still as their line began,<br />
It broaden'd out as it onward ran.<br />
<br />
Millom's proud courts had page and groom,<br />
To serve in hall, to wait in room;<br />
Maid and squire in fair array:<br />
But better than these, at close of day&mdash;<br />
Better than groom or page in hall,<br />
Than maid and squire, that came at a call,<br />
Was the Goblin Fiend, that shunn'd their sight,<br />
And wrought for the lords of Millom by night.<br />
<br />
When sleepy maidens left their fires,<br />
Hob-Thross forth from barns and byres<br />
Came tumbling in, and stretching his form<br />
Out over the hearthstone bright and warm,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>He folded his stunted thumbs, to dream<br />
For an idle hour ere he sipp'd his cream;<br />
Or smoothed his wrinkled visage to gaze<br />
On his hairy length at the kindly blaze.<br />
<br />
His snipp'd brown bowl of creamy store<br />
Set nightly&mdash;nothing Hob wanted more.<br />
He scoured, and delved, and groom'd, and churned;<br />
But favour or hire he scorned and spurned.<br />
Leave him alone to will and to do,<br />
Never were hand and heart so true.<br />
Tempt him with gift, or lay out his hire&mdash;<br />
Farewell Hob to farm and fire.<br />
<br />
Blest the manor, and blest the lord,<br />
That had Hob to work by field and board!<br />
Blest the field, and blest the farm,<br />
That Hob would keep from waste and harm!<br />
Or ever a wish was fairly thought,<br />
Hob was ready, and all was wrought;<br />
Was grain to be cut, or housed the corn,<br />
All was finish'd 'twixt night and morn.<br />
<br />
Millom's great lords rode round their land<br />
With courteous speech and bounteous hand.<br />
Hob-Thross too went forth to roam;<br />
Made every hearth in Millom his home.<br />
He thresh'd the oats, he churn'd the cream,<br />
He comb'd the manes of the stabled team,<br />
And fodder'd them well with corn and hay,<br />
When the lads were laggards at peep of day.<br />

For his service good, in that ancient hold,<br />
To them and to theirs for ages told,<br />
They wove him a coat of the finest wool,<br />
And a hood to wrap him when nights were cool.<br />
<br />
It broke his peace, and he could not stay.<br />
Hob took the clothes and went his way.<br />
He wrapp'd him round and he felt him warm:<br />
But his life at Millom lost all its charm.<br />
Night and day there was heard a wail<br />
In his ancient haunts, through wind and hail,&mdash;<br />
"Hob has got a new coat and new hood,<br />

Stretch'd in chancels, carved in stone.<br />
Gone to dust was all their power;<br />
Spiders wove in my lady's bower.<br />
While Hob in his coat and hood of green<br />
Went wooing by night the Elfin Queen.<br />
<br />
Call him to field, or wish him in stall,<br />
Hob-Thross answers no one's call.<br />
The snipp'd brown bowls of cream in vain<br />
On the hearths he loved are placed again.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "HOB-THROSS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The lords of Millom are connected with an ancient legend
of Egremont Castle, which is given elsewhere, and which
especially alludes to the horn and hatterell which they bore on
their helmets. This crest is said to have been assumed in the
time of Henry I., on the occasion of the grant of this seignory
by the Lord of Egremont to Godard de Boyvill or Boisville,
whose descendants retained possession of the greater part of it
for about one hundred years when it became vested by marriage
in Sir John Hudleston, whose pedigree is alleged to be traceable
for five generations before the Conquest. In this family
it remained for about five hundred years, when, for failure of
male issue it was sold to Sir James Lowther, nearly a century
ago. The names of the first possessors are now almost
forgotten in their own lands. The castle is of great antiquity.
It is uncertain at what date it was originally built; but it was
fortified and embattled by Sir John Hudleston, in 1335. In
ancient times it was surrounded by a fine park, of which there
are some scanty remains on a ridge to the north. The great
square tower is still habitable, though its old battlements are
gone. The castle was invested during the parliamentary war,
and the old vicarage house was pulled down at the same time,
"lest the rebels should take refuge there." There are traces
of the ancient moat still visible. Between the broken pillars
of an old gateway, an avenue leads to the front of the ruin,
which, though not of great extent, presents a fine specimen of
the decayed pomp of early times. The walls of the court yard
are all weather-stained and worn; and, here and there, delicate
beds of moss have crept over them, year after year, so
long, that the moist old stones are now matted with hues of
great beauty. The front of the castle is roofless, and some
parts of the massive walls are thickly clothed with ivy. A
fine flight of worn steps leads up through the archway, to the
great tower, in the inner court. Above the archway a stone
shield bears the decayed heraldries of the Hudleston family;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>and these arms appear, also, on a slab in the garden wall, and
in other parts of the buildings. The front entrance of the
great tower, from the inner court, when open, shews within
a fine old carved staircase, which leads one to suppose that the
interior may retain many of its ancient characteristics.</p>

<p>The church is a venerable building, with its quaint little
turret, containing two bells. The edifice consists of a nave
and chancel, a south aisle, and a modern porch on the same
side. The aisle was the burial place of the Hudlestons. Here
is an altar-tomb, ornamented with Gothic tracery and figures
bearing shields of arms, on which recline the figures of a knight
and his lady, in alabaster, very much mutilated. The knight
is in plate armour, his head resting on a helmet, and having a
collar of S.S.; the lady is dressed in a long gown and mantle,
with a veil. They appear to have originally been painted and
gilt, but the greater part of the colouring has been rubbed off.
Near the altar-tomb are the very mutilated remains of a knight,
carved in wood, apparently of the fourteenth century. A few
years ago there was a lion at his feet. A mural marble tablet
to the memory of the Hudleston family is on the wall of the
aisle.</p>

<p>The lordship of Millom is the largest seignory within the
barony of Egremont; its ancient boundaries being described
as the river Duddon on the east, the islands of Walney and
Piel de Foudray on the south, the Irish Sea on the west, and
the river Esk and the mountains Hardknot and Wrynose on
the north. It anciently enjoyed great privileges: it was a
special jurisdiction into which the sheriff of the county could
not enter: its lords had the power of life and death, and enjoyed
<i>jura regalia</i> in the six parishes forming their seignory,
namely, Millom, Bootle, Whicham, Whitbeck, Corney, and
Waberthwaite. Mr. Denton, writing in 1688, says that the
gallows stood on a hill near the Castle, on which criminals
had been executed within the memory of persons then living.
To commemorate the power anciently possessed by the lords
of this seignory, a stone has recently been erected with this
inscription&mdash;"Here the Lords of Millom exercised Jura
Regalia."</p>

<p>This lordship still retains its own coroner.</p>

<p>A small nunnery of Benedictines formerly existed within
this seignory, at Lekely in Seaton, which lies westward from
Bootle, near the sea. The precise date of its foundation cannot
be ascertained: but it appears to have taken place on or
before the time of Henry Boyvill, the fourth lord of Millom,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>who lived about the commencement of the thirteenth century;
and who "gave lands in Leakley, now called Seaton, to the
nuns;" and who in the deed of feofment of the manor of
Leakley made by the said Henry to Goynhild, his daughter,
on her marriage with Henry Fitz-William, excepts "the land
in Leakley which I gave to the holy nuns serving God and
Saint Mary in Leakley."</p>

<p>The nunnery was dedicated to St. Leonard; and was so
poor that it could not sufficiently maintain the prioress and
nuns. Wherefore the Duke of Lancaster, afterwards Henry
IV., by his charter, in 1357, granted to them in aid the hospital
of St. Leonard, at Lancaster, with power to appoint the
chantry priest to officiate in the said hospital. At the dissolution
the possessions of the priory were only of the annual value
of £12 12s. 6d. according to Dugdale, or £13 17s. 4d. by
Speed's valuation.</p>

<p>When at the suppression of Abbeys it came to the crown,
Henry VIII. gave the site and lands at Seaton to his servant
Sir Hugh Askew, and his heirs. This Knight was descended
from Thurston de Bosco, who lived in the days of King John
at a place then called the Aikskeugh, or Oakwood, near Millom,
and afterwards at Graymains, near Muncaster; and from
a poor estate was raised to great honour and preferment, by
his service to King Henry VIII. in his house and in the field.
Anne Askew, whose name stands so eminent in the annals of
martyrology, was one of his descendants.</p>

<p>There are few remains of the convent now left: some part
of the priory-chapel is still standing, particularly a fine window
with lancets, in the style of the thirteenth century. Seton-Hall,
formerly a part of the conventual buildings, and subsequently
the residence of Sir Hugh Askew, is now occupied as
a farm house.</p>

<p>Of Seton and Sir Hugh Askew, we have the following
quaint story in Sandford's M.S. account of Cumberland:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ffour miles southward stands Seaton, an estate of £500
per annum, sometimes a religious house, got by one Sir Hugo
Askew, yeoman of the sellar to Queen Catherine in Henry
Eight's time, and born in this contry. And when that Queen
was divorced from her husband, this yeoman was destitute.
And he applied for help to (the) Lo. Chamberlain for some
place or other in the King's service. The Lord Steward knew
him well, because he had helpt to a cup (of) wine ther before,
but told him he had no place for him but a charcoal carrier.
'Well' quoth this monsir Askew, 'help me in with one foot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>and let me gett in the other as I can.' And upon a great
holiday, the king looking out at some sports, Askew got a
courtier, a friend of his, to stand before the king; and Askew
gott on his velvet cassock and his gold chine, and basket of
chercole on his back, and marched in the king's sight with it.
'O,' saith the king, 'now I like yonder fellow well, that disdains
not to do his dirty office in his dainty clothes: what is
he?' Says his friend that stood by on purpose, 'It is Mr
Askew, that was yeoman of the sellar to the late Queen's
M<sup>tie</sup>, and now glad of this poor place to keep him in your
ma<sup>tie's</sup> service, which he will not forsake for all the world.'
The king says, 'I had the best wine when he was i'th cellar.
He is a gallant wine-taster: let him have his place againe;'
and after knighted him; and he sold his place, and married
the daughter of Sir John Hudleston; (and purchased<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> this
religious place of Seaton, nye wher he was borne, of an ancient
freehold family,) and settled this Seaton upon her, and she
afterwards married monsir Penengton, Lo: of Muncaster, and
had Mr. Joseph and a younger son with Penington, and gave
him this Seaton."</p>

<p>A brass plate on the south wall of the chancel of Bootle
Church, bears the effigies of a knight in armour, with the following
inscription in old English characters, indicating his
tomb. "Here lieth Sir Hughe Askew, knyght. late of the
seller to Kynge Edward the VI. which Sir Hughe was made
knyght, at Musselborough felde, in ye yeare of our Lord,
1547, and died the second day of Marche, in the yere of our
Lord God, 1562."</p>

<p>Among the local spirits of Cumberland, whose existence is
believed in by the vulgar, is one named Hob-Thross, whom
the old gossips report to have been frequently seen in the
shape of a "Body aw ower rough," lying by the fire side at
midnight. He was one of the class of creatures called Brownies,
and according to popular superstition, had especially attached
himself to the family at Millom Castle. He was a solitary
being, meagre, flat-nosed, shaggy and wild in his appearance,
and resembled the "lubbar fiend," so admirably described
by Milton in L'Allegro. Gervase of Tilbury speaks of him
as one of the "dæmones, senile vultu, facie corrugata, statura
pusilli, dimidium pollicis non habentes." In the day time he
lurked in remote recesses of the old houses which he delighted
to haunt; and, in the night, sedulously employed himself in
discharging any laborious task which he thought might be
acceptable to the family, to whose service he had devoted
himself. He loved to stretch himself by the kitchen fire when
the menials had taken their departure. Before the glimpse of
morn he would execute more work than could be done by a
man in ten days. He did not drudge from the hope of recompense:
on the contrary, so delicate was his attachment, that
the offer of reward, but particularly of food, infallibly would
occasion his disappearance for ever. He would receive, however,
if placed for him in a <i>snipped pot</i>, a quart of cream, or a
mess of milk-porridge. He had his regular range of farm
houses; and seems to have been a kind spirit, and willing to
do any thing he was required to do. The servant girls would
frequently put the cream in the churn, and say, "I wish Hob
would churn that," and they always found it done. Hob's
readiness to fulfil the wishes of his friends was sometimes
productive of ludicrous incidents. One evening there was
every prospect of rain next day, and a farmer had all his grain
out. "I wish," said he, "I had that grain housed." Next
morning Hob had housed every sheaf, but a fine stag which
had helped him was lying dead at the barn door. The day
however became extremely fine, and the farmer thought his
grain would have been better in the field: "I wish," said he,
"that Hob-Thross was in the mill-dam;" next morning all the
farmer's grain was in the mill-dam. Such were the tales which
were constantly told of the Millom Brownie, and as constantly
believed. He left the country at last, through the mistaken
kindness of some one, who made him a coat and hood to keep
him warm during the winter. He was heard at night singing
at his favourite haunts for a while about his apparel, and
"occupation gone," and at length left the country.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>The Cumberland tradition affirms that those persons who on
Fasting's-Even, as Shrove Tuesday is vulgarly called in the
North of England, do not eat heartily, are crammed with
barley chaff by Hob-Thross: and so careful are the villagers
to set the goblin at defiance, that scarcely a single hind retires
to rest without previously partaking of a hot supper.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott tells us that the last Brownie known in
Ettrick Forest, resided in Bodsbeck, a wild and solitary spot,
near the head of Moffat Water, where he exercised his functions
undisturbed, till the scrupulous devotion of an old lady
induced her <i>to hire him away</i>, as it was termed, by placing in
his haunt a porringer of milk and a piece of money. After
receiving this hint to depart, he was heard the whole night to
howl and cry, "Farewell to bonnie Bodsbeck!" which he
was compelled to abandon for ever.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE ABBOT OF CALDER.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The Abbot of Calder rode out from his gate<br />
To the town, saying, "Sorrow lies, early and late,<br />
In this wretched wide world upon every degree;<br />
And each child of the Church must have comfort from me!<br />
So on palfrey I wend to Lord Lucy's strong hold:<br />
For this life must press hard on these barons so bold."<br />
<br />
The Abbot was welcome to Lucy's proud hall.<br />
And he sat down with knights, and with ladies, and all,<br />
High at feast, joyous-hearted, light, gallant, and fair:<br />
Where to speak upon woe were but jesting with care.<br />
So his palfrey re-mounting at evening, he troll'd,<br />
"The world goes not ill with these barons so bold."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><br />
Ambling on by the forge, he drew up by the flame,<br />
"Well, my son! how is all with the children and dame?<br />
Toiling on!"&mdash;"Yes! but, father, not badly we speed;<br />
We have health; and for wealth, we lack nought that we need."<br />
Then at least, thought the Monk, here no text I need urge,<br />
For the world passes well with my friend at the forge!<br />
<br />
Turning off by the stream at the foot of the hill,<br />
All were busy, as bees in a hive, at the mill.<br />
"Benedicite!" cried he to women and wives,<br />
Where they sang at their labour as if for their lives,<br />
All so fat, fair, and fruitful. The Abbot jogg'd on,<br />
Humming, "Sweet, too, is rest when the labour is done."<br />
<br />
As he pass'd by the lane that leads up to the stile,<br />
Pretty Lillie came down with her curtsey and smile,&mdash;<br />
"Well, my daughter!" the Abbot said, chucking her chin;<br />
"How is Robin?&mdash;or Reuben? which&mdash;which is to win?"<br />
"&mdash;Thank you!&mdash;Robin," she said, as she blushed in her sleeve;<br />
While the Monk, spurring on, laughed a joyous "good eve!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><br />
On the verge of the chase rode the falconer by:<br />
With a song on his lip and a laugh in his eye,<br />
All the day o'er the moors he had gallop'd, and now<br />
He was off to the quintain-match over the brow;<br />
Then to crown with good cheer all the sports of the day.<br />
And the Abbot sighed, "Springtime, and beautiful May!"<br />
<br />
And at length in the hollow he came, as he rode,<br />
To the forester Robin's trim cottage abode.<br />
And there stood the youth, ruddy, stalwart, and curled:&mdash;<br />
"&mdash;Ha, Robin! this looks not like strife with the world!"&mdash;<br />
"No! and please you, good father, <i>she's</i> coming to-morrow!"<br />
"&mdash;Well! a blessing on both of you!&mdash;keep you from sorrow."<br />
<br />
So he reached his fair Abbey by Calder's sweet stream,<br />
Well believing all troubles in life are a dream;<br />
Looked around on his park and his fertile domain,<br />
With a thought to his cellars, a glance at his grain;<br />
While the stream through his meadow-lands rippled and purled;<br />
And exclaimed, "What a place is a sorrowful world!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><br />
And the Abbot of Calder that night o'er his bowl<br />
Felt a peace passing speech in the depths of his soul.<br />
And he dreamt mid the noise and the merry uproar<br />
Of the brethren beneath&mdash;all his fasting was o'er;<br />
That earth's many woes had to darkness been driven;<br />
And the sweet woods of Calder were gardens in Heaven.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE ABBOT OF CALDER."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>On the northern bank of the river Calder, in a deeply
secluded vale, sheltered by majestic forest trees, which rise
from the skirts of level and luxuriant meadows to the tops of
the surrounding hills, stands the ruined Abbey and home of
that little colony of Monks, who, with their Abbot Gerold at
their head, were detached from the mother Abbey of Furness
in 1134 to begin their fortunes under the auspices of Ranulph
de Meschines (the second of the name) their powerful neighbour
and founder. Here they contrived to live "in some
discomfort and great poverty for four years, when an army of
Scots under King David despoiled the lately begun Abbey and
carried away all its possessions. Finding they could get no
help elsewhere, the hapless thirteen resolved to return to the
maternal monastery" for refuge. This happened about the
third year of King Stephen.</p>

<p>The Abbot of Furness refused to receive Gerold and his
companions, reproaching them with cowardice for abandoning
their monastery, and alleging that it was rather the love of
that ease and plenty which they expected in Furness,
than the devastation of the Scottish army, that forced them
from Calder. Some writers say that the Abbot of Furness
insisted that Gerold should divest himself of his authority, and
absolve the monks from their obedience to him, as a condition
of their receiving any relief. This, Gerold and his companions
refused to do, and turning their faces from Furness, they, with
the remains of their broken fortune, which consisted of little
more than some clothes and a few books, with one cart and
eight oxen, taking providence for their guide, went in quest of
better hospitality.</p>

<p>The result of the next day's resolution was to address themselves
to Thurstan, Archbishop of York, and beg his advice
and relief. The reception they met with from him, answered
their wishes; the Archbishop graciously received them, and
charitably entertained them for some time, then recommended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>them to Gundrede de Aubigny, who sent them to Robert de
Alneto, her brother, a hermit, at Hode, in the East Riding of
Yorkshire, where for a period she supplied them with
necessaries. They afterwards obtained a monastery of their
own called Byland, when they voluntarily made themselves
dependant upon Savigny, in order that Furness should exercise
no right of paternity over them.</p>

<p>In the same year, 1142, the Abbot of Furness understanding
that Gerold had obtained a settlement, sent another colony,
with Hardred, a Furness monk, for their Abbot, to take possession
of ravaged Calder, which the Lord of Egremont,
William Fitz-Duncan, nephew of David, King of Scots, had
refounded. Their endowments and revenues were chiefly from
the founder's munificence, and were small, being valued, at
the suppression, at about sixty pounds per annum.</p>

<p>The ruins of this Abbey are approached from Calder-Bridge
by a pleasant walk for about a mile on the banks of the river,
presenting several glimpses of the tower rising out of the foliage
of the forest trees by which it is surrounded.</p>

<p>The Abbey Church was in the form of a cross, and small,
the width of the chancel being only twenty five feet, and that
of the transepts twenty two. Of the western front little more
than the Norman doorway remains. The five pointed arches
of the north side of the nave, dividing it from the aisle; the
choir; the transepts, with a side chapel on the south; the
square tower supported by four lofty pointed arches; the
walls and windows of a small cloister running south; with the
remains of upper chambers, showing a range of eight windows
to the west and seven to the east, beautiful specimens of early
English Architecture, terminated by a modern mansion, occupying
the site of the conventual buildings, but built in a style
altogether unsuited to the locality; these, with the porter's lodge
at a short distance from the west end, and a large oven by the
side of a rapid stream in the meadow on the east, all so changed
since the times of Gerold and Hardred, constitute in our days
the Abbey of Calder.</p>

<p>Against the walls of the Abbey are fragments of various
sepulchral figures, which from the mutilated sculptures and
devices on the shields, would seem to have belonged to the
tombs of eminent persons. One of them is represented in a
coat of mail, with his hand upon his sword; another bears a
shield reversed, as a mark of disgrace for cowardice or
treachery; "but," says Hutchinson, "the virtues of the one,
and the errors of the other, are alike given to oblivion by the
hand of time and by the scourging angel Dissolution."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir John le Fleming, of Beckermet, ancestor of the Flemings
of Rydal Hall, Westmorland, gave lands in Great Beckermet
to this abbey, in the 26th year of Henry III, A. D.
1242. He died during that long reign, and was buried in the
abbey. One of the effigies above alluded to, with the shield
charged fretty, is probably that mentioned by Sir Daniel
Fleming, who says that in his time (in the seventeenth century)
here was "a very ancient statue of a man in armour, with a
frett (of six pieces) upon his shield, lying upon his back, with
his sword by his side, his hands elevated in a posture of
prayer, and legs across; being so placed probably from his
taking upon him the cross, and being engaged in the holy
war. Which statue was placed there most probably in
memory of this Sir John le Fleming."</p>

<p>Among some ancient charters and documents in the possession
of William John Charlton, of Hesleyside, Esq., (1830) and
which came into his family, in 1680, by the marriage of his
great-great-grandfather, with Mary, daughter of Francis
Salkeld, in the parish of All-Hallows, in Cumberland, Esq.,
is one that is very curious. It is an assignment made in
A. D. 1291, by John, son of John de Hudleston, of William,
son of Richard de Loftscales, formerly his native, with all his
retinue and chattels, to the Abbot and Monks of Caldra. The
deed is witnessed by "Willmo. Wailburthuait. Willmo.
Thuaites. Johe de Mordling. Johe Corbet. Johe de Halle
et aliis:" and is alluded to in the following passages quoted
by Mr. Jefferson from <i>Archælogia Æliana</i>. "It is, in fact,
that species of grant of freedom to a slave, which is called
manumission implied, in which the lord yields up all obligation
to bondage, on condition of the native agreeing to an annual
payment of money on a certain day. The clause, 'so that
from this time they may be free, and exempt from all servitude
and reproach of villainage from me and my heirs,' is very
curious, especially to persons of our times, on which there has
been so much said about the pomp of Eastern lords, and the
reproachful slavery in which their dependents are still kept.
Here the Monks of Caldra redeemed a man, his family, and
property from slavery, on condition of his paying them the
small sum of two pence a-year. The Hudleston family were
seated at Millum, in the time of Henry the Third, when they
acquired that estate, by the marriage of John de Hudleston
with the Lady Joan, the heiress of the Boisville family."</p>

<p>"Slavery continued to thrive on the soil of Northumberland
long after the time of Edward the First; for in 1470, Sir Roger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>Widdrington manumitted his native, William Atkinson, for
the purpose of making him his bailiff of Woodhorn."</p>

<p>The inmates of Calder were probably neither better nor
worse than other cowled fraternities. A certain Brother
Beesley, a Benedictine Monk, of Pershore, in Worcestershire,
speaks very boldly of certain shortcomings, in his own experience
of "relygyus men." The following passage occurs in a
petition addressed by him to the Vicar-General Cromwell, at
the time of the visitation of the Monasteries:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now y wyll ynstrux your grace sumwatt of relygyus men&mdash;&mdash;.
Monckes drynke an bowll after collatyon tyll ten or
twelve of the clok, and cum to matyns as dronck as myss
(mice)&mdash;and sum at cardys, sum at dyes, and at tabulles;
sum cum to mattyns begenying at the mydes, and sum wen
yt ys almost dun, and wold not cum there so only for boddly
punyshment, nothyng for Goddes sayck."</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE ARMBOTH BANQUET.</h2>

<div class="poem">
To Calgarth Hall in the midnight cold<br />
Two headless skeletons cross'd the fold,<br />
Undid the bars, unlatched the door,<br />
And over the step pass'd down the floor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Where the jolly round porter sat sleeping.</span><br />
<br />
With a patter their feet on the pavement fall;<br />
And they traverse the stairs to that window'd wall,<br />
Where out of a niche, at the witch-hour dark,<br />
Each lifts a skull all grinning and stark,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And fits it on with a creaking.</span><br />
<br />
Then forth they go with a ghostly march;<br />
And bending low at the portal arch,<br />
Through Calgarth woods, o'er Rydal braes,<br />
And over the Pass by Dunmail-Raise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The Two their course are keeping.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span><br />
Now Wytheburn's lowly pile in sight<br />
Gleams faintly beneath the new-moon's light;<br />
And farther along dim forms appear,<br />
All hurrying down to the darksome Mere,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The drunken ferryman seeking.</span><br />
<br />
From old Helvellyn's domain they come,<br />
A spectral band demure and dumb;<br />
By twos, and threes, and fours, and more,<br />
They beckon the man to ferry them o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">To where yon lights are breaking.</span><br />
<br />
And thither the twain are wending fast;<br />
For there from many a casement cast,<br />
The festal blaze is burning high<br />
In Armboth Hall; the hills thereby<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">In uttermost darkness sleeping.</span><br />
<br />
In Wytheburn City there wakes not one<br />
To see those dim forms hastening on;<br />
But at Wytheburn Ferry may travellers wait,<br />
For busy with guests for Armboth gate,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The boatman's sinews are aching.</span><br />
<br />
They've reached the shore, they've cross'd the sward<br />
To where the old portal stands unbarr'd.<br />
With courteous steps and bearing high<br />
They pass the hollow-eyed porter by,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">With his torch high over him sweeping.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span><br />
Then might the owls that move by night<br />
Have seen thin shadows flit through the light,<br />
Where the windows glared along the wall<br />
In every chamber of Armboth Hall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">And the guests high revel were keeping.</span><br />
<br />
Then too from cold and weary ways<br />
A traveller's eyes had caught the rays:<br />
And wandering on to the silent door<br />
He knocked aloud&mdash;he knew no more;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">But the lights went out like winking.</span><br />
<br />
A wreath of mist rushed over the Mere,<br />
And reached Helvellyn as dawn grew near;<br />
And two thin streaks went down the wind<br />
O'er Dunmail-Raise with a storm behind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">The leaves in Grasmere raking.</span><br />
<br />
On Rydal isles the herons awoke;<br />
A pattering cloud by Wansfell broke;<br />
And the grey cock stretched his neck to crow<br />
In Calgarth roost, that ghosts might know<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">It was time for maids to be waking.</span><br />
<br />
The skeletons two rushed through the yard,<br />
They pushed the door they left unbarr'd,<br />
Laid by their skulls in the niched wall,<br />
And flew like wind from Calgarth Hall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Where still the round porter sat sleeping.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span><br />
As out they rattled, the wind rushed in<br />
And slamm'd the doors with a terrible din;<br />
The grey cock crew; the dogs were raised;<br />
And the old porter rubb'd his eyes amazed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">At the dawn so coldly breaking.</span><br />
<br />
And lying at morn by Armboth gate<br />
Was found the form that knocked so late;<br />
A traveller footworn, mired, and grey,<br />
Who, led by marsh lights lost his way,<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE ARMBOTH BANQUET."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The Old Hall of Calgarth, whose history, it has been said,
belongs to the world of shadows, but whose remains still form
an object of interest from their picturesqueness and antiquity,
is situated within a short distance of the water, upon the
narrowest part of a small and pleasant plain on the eastern
shore of Windermere. The house has been so much injured
and curtailed of its original proportions, that it is impossible
to make out what has been its precise form: many parts having
gone entirely to decay, and others being much out of
repair; the materials having been used in the erection of
offices and outbuildings, for the accommodation of farmers, in
whose occupation it has been for a long period. Its original
character has been quite lost in the additions and alterations
of later days. It is however said to have been constructed
much after the style of those venerable Westmorland mansions,
the Halls of Sizergh and Levens. But there are few traces of
the "fair old building," which even so late as the year 1774,
Dr. Burn described it to be; and the destruction of this
ancient home of the Philipsons has well nigh been complete.
What is now called the kitchen, and the room over it, are the
only portions of the interior remaining, from which a judgment
may be formed of the care and finish that have been
applied to its internal decoration. In the former, which appears
to have been one of the principal apartments, though
now divided, and appropriated to humble uses, the armorial
achievements of the Philipsons, crested with the five ostrich
plumes of their house, and surmounted by their motto, "Fide
non fraude," together with the bearings of Wyvill impaling
Carus, into which families the owners of Calgarth intermarried,
are coarsely represented in stucco over the hearth, and still
serve to connect their name with the house. The large old
open fireplace has been filled up by an insignificant modern
invention. The window still retains some fragments of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>former display of heraldic honours; the arms of the early
owners, impaling those of Wyvill, and the device of Briggs,
another Westmorland family, with whom the Philipsons were
also matrimonially connected, yet appear in their proper
blazon. And in the same window, underneath the emblazonry,
is this legend, likewise in painted glass:&mdash;</p>

<p>The old dining table of black oak, reduced in its dimensions,
occupies one side of this apartment. The room over the
kitchen, to which a steep stair rises from the threshold of the
porch, and which looks over the lake, has been nobly ornamented
after the fashion of the day, by cunning artists, and it
still retains in its dilapidated oak work, and richly adorned
ceiling, choice, though rude remnants of its former splendour.
It has a dark polished oak floor, and is wainscotted on three
sides, with the same tough wood, which, bleached with age,
is elaborately carved in regular intersecting panels, inlaid with
scroll-work and tracery, enriched by pilasters, and surmounted
by an embattled cornice. In this wainscot two or three doors
indicate the entrances to other rooms, whose approaches are
walled up, the rooms themselves having been long since
destroyed. The ceiling is flat, and formed into compartments
by heavy square intersecting moulded ribs, the intermediate
spaces of which are excessively adorned with cumbrous ornamental
work of the most grotesque figures and designs imaginable,
amidst which festoons of flowers, fruits, and other
products of the earth, mingled with heraldic achievements,
moulded in stucco, yet exist, to tell how many times the fruitage
and the leaves outside have come and gone, have ripened
and decayed, whilst they endure unchanged.</p>

<p>In the window of the staircase leading to this chamber
tradition has localized the famous legend of the skulls of Old
Calgarth. The dilapidated, and somewhat melancholy appearance
of the dwelling, in concurrence with the superstitious
notions which have ever been common in country places, have
probably given rise to a report, which has long prevailed, that
the house is haunted. Many stories are current of the frightful
visions and mischievous deeds, which the goblins of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>place are said to have performed, to terrify and distress the
harmless neighbourhood; and these fables are not yet entirely
disbelieved. Spectres yet are occasionally to be seen within
its precincts. And the two human skulls, whose history and
reputed properties are too singular not to have contributed
greatly to the story of the house being haunted, are, although
out of sight, still within it, and as indestructible as ever.</p>

<p>These were wont to occupy a niche beneath the window of
the staircase: and in 1775, when Mr. West visited the Hall,
they still remained in the place where they had lain from time
immemorial. All attempts, it is said, to dispossess them of
the station they had chosen to occupy, have invariably proved
fruitless. As the report goes, they have been buried, burnt,
reduced to powder and dispersed in the wind, sunk in the
well, and thrown into the lake, several times, to no purpose
as to their permanent removal or destruction. Till at length,
so persistent was found to be their attachment to the niche
which they had selected for their abiding place, they are said
to have been, as a last resource to keep them out of sight,
walled up within it; and there they remain. Of course, many
persons now living in the neighbourhood can bear testimony
to the fact that the skulls did really occupy the place assigned
to them by tradition.</p>

<p>A popular tale of immemorial standing relates that the
skulls were those of an aged man and his wife, who lived on
their own property adjoining the lands of the Philipsons, whose
head regarded it with a covetous eye, and had long desired
to number it among his extensive domains. The owners however
not being willing to part with it, he determined in evil
hour to have it at any cost.</p>

<p>The old people, as the story runs, were in the habit of going
frequently to the Hall, to share in the viands which fell from
the lord's table, for he was a bounteous man to the poor; and
it happened once that a pie was given to them, into which had
been put some articles of plate. After their return home, the
valuables were missed, and the cottage being searched, the
things were found therein. The result was as the author of
the mischief had plotted. They were accused of theft, tried,
convicted, and sentenced to be executed, and their persecutor
ultimately got their inheritance. When brought up for execution,
the condemned persons requested the chaplain in attendance
to read the 109th psalm; for under their circumstances,
there was an awful significance in the imprecatory verses,
which denounced the conduct of evil doers like Philipson;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>and in the solemn malison prophesied against the cruel, they
pronounced a curse upon the owners of Calgarth, which the
gossips of the neighbourhood say has ever since cast its blight
upon the proprietorship of the estate; and that, notwithstanding
whatever authentic records may prove to the contrary, the
traditionary malediction has been regularly fulfilled down to
the present time. After the death of his victims, the oppressor
was greatly tormented; for, as if to perpetuate the memory of
such injustice, and as a memento of their innocence, their
skulls came and took up a position in the window of one of
the rooms in the Hall, from whence they could not by any
means be effectually removed, the common belief being that
they were for that end indestructible, and it was stoutly asserted
that to whatever place they were taken, or however used, they
invariably reappeared in their old station by the window.</p>

<p>The property of Calgarth came by purchase into the possession
of the late Dr. Watson, Lord Bishop of Llandaff, who
built a mansion upon the estate, where he passed much of the
later period of his life: and who lies buried in the neighbouring
churchyard of Bowness. The Bishop's grandson, Richard
Luther Watson, Esquire, is the present possessor.</p>

<p>It is believed that anciently a burial ground was attached to
the buildings of Old Calgarth; as when the ground has been
trenched thereabouts, quantities of human bones have frequently
been turned over and re-buried. There are now in
the dairy of the Old Hall two flat tombstones, with the name
of Philipson inscribed upon them, which not very many years
ago were dug up in the garden near the house; their present
use being a desecration quite in accordance with the associations
which hang around the place. This circumstance may
afford a clue to the re-appearance of the skulls so frequently,
after every art of destruction had been tried upon them, in the
mysterious chambers of Old Calgarth Hall.</p>

<p>The old house at Armboth, on Thirlmere, has also the
reputation of being occasionally at midnight supernaturally
lighted up for the reception of spectres, which cross the lake
from Helvellyn for some mysterious purpose within its walls.
The long low white edifice lying close under the fells which
rise abruptly behind it, with the black waters of the lake in
front, has something very gloomy and weird-like about its
aspect, which does not ill accord with those superstitious
ideas with which it is sometimes associated. As Miss
Martineau has said, "there is really something remarkable,
and like witchery, about the house. On a bright moonlight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>night, the spectator who looks towards it from a distance of
two or three miles, sees the light reflected from its windows
into the lake; and when a slight fog gives a reddish hue to the
light, the whole might easily be taken for an illumination of a
great mansion. And this mansion seems to vanish as you approach,&mdash;being
no mansion, but a small house lying in a nook,
and overshadowed by a hill."</p>

<p>The City of Wytheburn is the name given to a few houses,
some of them graced by native trees, and others by grotesquely
cut yew trees, distant about half a mile from the head of
Thirlmere.</p></blockquote>

<h3>NOTES TO "BRITTA IN THE TEMPLE OF THE
DRUIDS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Traces of the Celts are clearly distinguishable in the names
of some of the more prominent mountains within a few miles
of Keswick, Skiddaw, Blencathra, Glaramara, Cat-Bells, Helvellyn.
The first is derived from the name of the solar god,
Ska-da, one of the appellations of the chief deity of Celtic
Britain, to whom Skiddaw was consecrated. The second has
been supposed to be a corruption of blen-y-cathern, the "peak
of witches"; the fourth to signify "the groves of Baal"; and
the last El-Velin, "the hill of Baal or Veli." The worship
of the Assyrian deity was celebrated amongst the Celtic inhabitants
of our island with the greatest importance and
solemnity. The stone circles are still remaining in many
places where the bloody sacrifices to his honour were performed:
and one of the most important of these is near Keswick.
In the immediate vicinity is also a gloomy valley,
Glenderaterra, the name of which is sufficiently indicative of
the purpose for which, like Tophet of old, it was ordained;
Glyn-dera taran signifying in Celtic, "the valley of the angel
or demon of execution."</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that till the last few years, a trace also of
the ancient worship still lingered around two temples in this
county, where it was once habitually performed. Both at
Keswick, and at Cumwhitton where there is a similar druidical
circle, the festival of the Beltein, or the fire of Baal, was till
very recently celebrated on the first of May. As the Jews had
by their "prophets of the groves," made their children "pass
through the fire to Baal"; so the Britons, taught by their
Druids, were accustomed once a year to drive their flocks and
herds through the fire, to preserve them from evil during the
remainder of the year. Indeed the custom still prevails. If
the cows are distempered, it is actually a practice in many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>the dales to light "the Need-fire"; notice being given
throughout the neighbouring valleys, that the charm may be
sent for if wanted. "Need-fire" is said to mean cattle-fire,
and to be derived from the Danish <i>nod</i>, whence also is the
northern word nolt or nowte. The Need-fire is produced by
rubbing two slicks together. A great pile of combustible
stuff is prepared, to give as much smoke as possible. When
lighted, the neighbours snatch some of the fire, hurry
home with it, and light their respective piles; and the
cattle, diseased and sound, are then driven through the
flame. Mr. Gibson says, that in 1841, when the cattle-murrain
prevailed in Cumberland, he had many opportunities
of witnessing the application of this charm to animals
both diseased and sound. And he tells us, that to ensure
its efficacy it was necessary to observe certain conditions.
The fire had to be produced at first by friction, the domestic
fires in the neighbourhood being all previously extinguished;
then it had to be brought spontaneously to each farm by some
neighbour unsolicited: and neither the fire so brought, nor
any part of the fuel used, must ever have been under a roof.
These conditions being observed, a great fire was made, and
the cattle driven to and fro in the smoke. One honest
farmer who had an ailing wife and delicate children passed
<i>them</i> through this ordeal, as was averred with most beneficial
effect. Another inadvertently carried the fire just brought to
him into his house to save it from extinction by a sudden
shower: and it was declared that in his case the need-fire
would be inoperative. "It is interesting," says Mr. Ferguson,
"to see how men cling to the performance of ancient religious
rites, when the significance of the ceremony has long been
forgotten; and what a hold must that worship have held
over the minds of men, which Thor and Odin have not
supplanted, nor the Christianity of a thousand years."</p>

<p>The tribe of ancient Britons who occupied Cumberland previous
to the Roman conquest, the Brigantes, who were as
wild and uncultivated as their native hills, subsisting principally
by hunting and the spontaneous fruits of the earth;
wearing for their clothing the skins of animals, and dwelling
in habitations formed by the pillars of the forest rooted in the
earth, and enclosed by interwoven branches, or in caves; have
left one undoubted specimen of their race behind them. In
the parish of Scaleby, in Cumberland, the land on the north
end is barren, and large quantities of peat are cut and sent to
Carlisle and other places for sale. At the depth of nine feet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>in this peat moss, has been found the skeleton of an ancient
Briton, enclosed in the skin of some wild animal, and carefully
bound up with thongs of tanned leather. It is conjectured
that the body must have lain in the moss since the invasion of
Julius Cæsar, and from the position in which the skeleton was
found, grasping a stick about three feet long and twelve inches
in circumference, it is supposed he must have perished accidentally
on the spot. The remains were not long ago in the
possession of the rector and Dr. Graham of Netherhouse.</p>

<p>In this part of the island the Britons were not in the worst
state of mental darkness; these were not ignorant of a Deity,
and they were not idolators. Their druids and bards possessed
all the learning of the age. And it is believed that some of
the Chief Druids had their station in Cumberland, where many
of their monuments still remain, and of these one of the most
noble and extensive of any in the island is the circle near Keswick.
It stands on an eminence, about a mile and a half on
the old road to Penrith, in a field on the right hand. The
spot is the most commanding which could be chosen in that
part of the country, without climbing a mountain. Derwentwater
and the vale of Keswick are not seen from it, only the
mountains that enclose them on the south and west. Latrigg
and the huge side of Skiddaw are on the north: to the east is
the open country towards Penrith, with Mell fell in the distance,
where it rises alone like a huge tumulus on the right,
and Blencathra on the left, rent into deep ravines. On the
south east is the range of Helvellyn, from its termination at
Wanthwaite Craggs to its loftiest summits, and to Dunmail
Raise. The lower range of Nathdale Fells lies nearer in a
line parallel with Helvellyn. The heights above Leathes
Water, with the Borrowdale mountains complete the panorama.</p>

<p>This circle is formed of stones of various forms, natural and
unhewn, of a species of granite; of a kind, according to
Clarke, not to be found within many miles of this place. The
largest is nearly eight feet high, and fifteen feet in circumference;
most of them are still erect, but some are fallen.
They are set in a form not exactly circular; the diameter
being thirty paces from east to west, and thirty-two from north
to south. At the eastern end a small enclosure is formed
within the circle by ten stones, making an oblong square in
conjunction with the stones on that side of the circle, seven
paces in length, and three in width within. At the opposite
side a single square stone is placed at the distance of three
paces from the circle.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>Concerning this, like all similar monuments in great Britain,
the popular superstition prevails, that no two persons can number
the stones alike, and that no person will ever find a second
count confirm the first. This notion is curiously illustrated by
the various writers who have described it. According to
Gough, Stukely states the number to be forty; Gray says they
are fifty; Hutchinson makes them fifty; Clarke made them
out to be fifty-two; others, more correctly, forty-eight.
Southey says, the number of stones which compose the circle
is thirty-eight, and besides these there are ten which form
three sides of a little square within, on the eastern side, three
stones of the circle itself forming the fourth; this being evidently
the place where the Druids who presided had their
station; or where the more sacred and important part of the
rites and ceremonies (whatever they may have been) were performed.</p>

<p>The singularity noticed in this monument, and what distinguishes
it from all other druidical remains of this nature,
is the recess on the eastern side of the area. Mr. Pennant
supposes it to have been allotted for the Druids, the priests of
the place, as a peculiar sanctuary, a sort of holy of holies,
where they met, separated from the vulgar, to perform their
rites, their divinations, or to sit in council to determine on
controversies, to compromise all differences about limits of
land, or about inheritances, or for the trial of greater criminals.
The cause that this recess was on the east side, seems to arise
from the respect paid by the ancient Britons to Baal or the
Sun; not originally an idolatrous respect, but merely as a
symbol of the Creator.</p>

<p>The rude workmanship, or rather arrangement, of these
structures, for it cannot be called architecture, indicates the
great barbarity of the times of the Druids; and furnishes
strong proof of the savage nature of these heathen priests.
Within this magical circle we may conceive any incantations
to have been performed, and any rites of superstition to have
been celebrated; their human executions, their imposing sacrifices;
and their inhuman method of offering up their victims,
by enclosing them in a gigantic figure of Hercules (the emblem
of human virtue) made of wicker work, and burning them
alive in sacrifice to the divine attribute of Justice.</p>

<p>This impressive monument of former times (the Keswick
circle) is carefully preserved: the soil within the enclosure is
not broken; a path from the road is left, and a stepping style
has been placed, to accommodate visitors with an easy access
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>to it. The old legend about the last human sacrifice of the
Druids belongs to this monument. Gilpin says, "a romantic
place seldom wants a romantic story to adorn it." And here
certainly, amidst unmistakeable evidences of the worship of
Baal: within sight of the vale (St. John's) which reveals the
isolated rock, once the enchanted fortress of the powerful Merlin:
within sound of the Greta, "the mourner," "the loud
lamenter," in whose torrents are heard voices complaining
among the stones: within range of Souter Fell with its
shadowy armies and spectres marching in military array, why
and whence and whither we know not; here, if anywhere, the
very realm of mystery and superstition is made manifest to us,
with almost awful significance; overlying the fairest scenes of
nature, and investing them with all the charms of a region of
romance.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of this temple, too, is not without a
certain notoriety on account of the violent floods with which it
has been visited even in modern times. Hutchinson speaks of
a remarkable one caused by impetuous rains, which happened
on the twenty-second of August, 1749, in the vale of St.
John's. "The clouds discharged their torrents like a waterspout;
the streams from the mountains uniting, at length
became so powerful a body, as to rend up the soil, gravel, and
stones to a prodigious depth, and bear with them mighty fragments
of rocks; several cottages were swept away from the
declivities where they had stood in safety for a century; the
vale was deluged, and many of the inhabitants with their cattle
were lost. A singular providence protected many lives, a
little school, where all the youths of the neighbourhood were
educated, at the instant crowded with its flock, stood in the
very line of one of these torrents, but the hand of God, in a
miraculous manner, stayed a rolling rock, in the midst of its
dreadful course, which would have crushed the whole tenement
with its innocents; and by its stand, the floods divided, and
passed on this hand and on that, insulating the school-house,
and leaving the pupils with their master, trembling at once for
the dangers escaped and as spectators of the horrid havock in
the valley, and the tremendous floods which encompassed
them on every side." He received this account from one of
the people then at school: and also gives the following description
of that inundation, which he had met with. "It
began with most terrible thunder and incessant lightning, the
preceding day having been extremely hot and sultry; the inhabitants
for two hours before the breaking of the cloud, heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>a strange noise, like the wind blowing in the tops of high trees.
It is thought to have been a spout or a large body of water, by
which the lightning incessantly rarifying the air, broke at once
on the tops of the mountains, and descended upon the valley
below, which is about three miles long, half a mile broad, and
lies nearly east and west, being closed on the south and
north sides with prodigious high, steep, and rocky mountains.
Legbert Fells on the north side, received almost the whole
cataract, for the spout did not extend above a mile in length;
it chiefly swelled four small brooks, but to so amazing a degree,
that the largest of them, called Catchertz Ghyll, swept
away a mill and other edifices in five minutes, leaving the
place where they stood covered with fragments of rocks and
rubbish three or four yards deep, insomuch that one of the
mill stones could not be found. During the violence of the
storm, the fragments of rock which rolled down the mountain,
choked up the old course of this brook; but the water forcing
its way through a shivery rock, formed a chasm four yards
wide and about eight or nine deep. The brooks lodged such
quantities of gravel and sand on the meadows, that they were
irrecoverably lost. Many large pieces of rocks were carried a
considerable way into the fields; some larger than a team of
ten horses could move, and one of them measuring nineteen
yards about." Clarke says, "Many falsehoods are related of
this inundation: for instance, the insulation of the school-house
with its assembled master and scholars, which, though commonly
told and believed, is not supported by any tradition of
the kind preserved in the neighbourhood." No doubt, the
circumstances are exaggerated: but even his own narrative
shows it to have been one of the most dreadful and destructive
inundations ever remembered in this country. He relates that
"all the evening of that 22nd day of August, horrid, tumultuous
noises were heard in the air; sometimes a puff of wind
would blow with great violence, then in a moment all was
calm again. The inhabitants, used to bosom-winds, whirlwinds,
and the howling of distant tempests among the rocks,
went to bed as usual, and from the fatigues of the day were in
a sound sleep when the inundation awoke them. About one
in the morning the rain began to fall, and before four such a
quantity fell as covered the whole face of the country below
with a sheet of water many feet deep; several houses were
filled with sand to the first story, many more driven down;
and among the rest Legberthwaite mill, of which not one stone
was left upon another; even the heavy millstones were washed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>away; one was found at a considerable distance, but the other
was never discovered. Several persons were obliged to climb
to the tops of the houses, to escape instantaneous death; and
there many were obliged to remain, in a situation of the most
dreadful suspense, till the waters abated. Mr. Mounsey of
Wallthwaite says, that when he came down stairs in the morning,
the first sight he saw was a gander belonging to one of
his neighbours, and several planks and kitchen utensils, which
were floating about his lower apartments, the violence of the
waters having forced open the doors on both sides of the house.
The most dreadful vestiges of this inundation, or waterspout,
are at a place called Lob-Wath, a little above Wallthwaite;
here thousands of prodigious stones are piled upon each other,
to the height of eleven yards; many of these stones are upwards
of twenty tons weight each, and are thrown together in
such a manner as to be at once the object of curiosity and
horror.</p>

<p>"The quantity of water which had fallen here is truly astonishing;
more particularly considering the small space it
had to collect in. The distance from Lob-Wath to Wolf-Crag,
is not more than a mile and a half, and there could none collect
much above Wolf-Crag; nor did the rain extend more
than eight miles in any direction. At Melfell only three miles
distant, the farmers were leading corn all night (as is customary
when they fear ill weather,) and no rain fell there; yet such
was the fury of the descending torrent, that the fields at Fornside
exhibited nothing but devastation. Here a large tree
broken in two, there one torn up by the root, and the ground
everywhere covered with sand and stones." The rivulet called
Mosedale Beck, which has its source between the mountains
Dodd and Wolf-Crag, was by its sudden and continuous overflow
the chief contributory of the inundation.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE LADY OF WORKINGTON HALL.</h2>

<div class="poem">
In her neat country kirtle and kerchief array'd,<br />
A wild little maiden tripp'd through the green shade;<br />
With her pitcher, just filled from the rill, at her side,<br />
And a song on her lip of the Solway's rude tide;<br />
When a rider came by, gallant, youthful, and gay&mdash;<br />
"Pretty Maid, let me drink! and good luck to your lay!"<br />
<br />
As he glanced o'er the brim, arch and sweet was her smile;<br />
Then "Adieu!" passing on, he sang gaily the while&mdash;<br />
"Who knows what may happen, or what may befall?<br />
I may be&mdash;&mdash;" something she could not recall:<br />
For the tramp of his steed mingled in with the tone,<br />
And the burden ceased, broken&mdash;the singer was gone.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span><br />
There are words, notes, and whisperings, broken and few,<br />
That from depths in the soul will oft start up anew,<br />
Like a dream voice, unconsciously, early or late,<br />
Mid all changes of circumstance, fortune, and fate,<br />
Unappealed to, unsought for, unreck'd of, and brought<br />
From afar to the tongue without effort or thought.<br />
<br />
And 'twas thus the few notes which she caught of that strain<br />
Often stirr'd on the lips of the Maiden again.<br />
When a child at the school or a maid at the Hall&mdash;<br />
"Who knows what may happen, or what may befall?<br />
I may be&mdash;" lilted she low, as she sate<br />
At her finger-work meekly, or stroll'd by the gate.<br />
<br />
So it chanced as she robed on one morning her bloom<br />
With a mantle of state, in her lost Lady's room;<br />
While the mirror gave back to her sight all her charms;<br />
Came that strain to her lip as she folded her arms&mdash;<br />
"Who knows what may happen, or what may befall?<br />
I may be&mdash;Lady of Workington Hall!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><br />
Thus the wild-hearted Maid ended gaily the song.<br />
Like a flash from the mirror it glanced from her tongue,<br />
Void of meaning or thought of the future; but lo!<br />
There's a witness beside her the glass does not show.<br />
From a distance unseen are displayed to the eyes<br />
Of her Lord all her pranks in that courtly disguise.<br />
<br />
He charged the proud Butler, that evening to call<br />
To high feast all the maidens and grooms of the Hall;<br />
To send round the bowl, and when mirth flowing high<br />
Brought the heart to the lip, the bright soul to the eye,<br />
At the sound of his footstep to crown their good cheer<br />
With a round to the toast he has breathed in his ear.<br />
<br />
Bold and stern, on that evening arose mid the crowd<br />
The bold Butler, and called for a bumper aloud:<br />
Look'd around on the bevy of maidens and men:<br />
Glanced his eye past the Beauty, and spoke out again&mdash;<br />
"Who knows what may happen, or what may befall?<br />
Let us drink to the Lady of Workington Hall."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span><br />
How they stared at each other, how glanced at their Lord,<br />
As he entered that moment and stood by the board,<br />
How they trembled to witness his eye's flashing ray,<br />
Was a sight to be seen that no art can portray.<br />
But the one conscious Maid who could read it alone,<br />
With a shriek, like a vanishing spirit was gone.<br />
<br />
But in vain! What the fates have determined will come!<br />
And in time, tired of clangour of trumpet, and drum,<br />
Came the Heir to the Hall of his ancestry old;<br />
Met the Maid of the pitcher once more as he stroll'd;<br />
Woo'd and won her, in spite of whate'er might befall;<br />
And made her the Lady of Workington Hall.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE LADY OF WORKINGTON
HALL."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The ancient family of the Curwens of Workington can trace
their descent to Ivo de Tailbois and Elgiva daughter of
Ethelred, King of England. Ivo came to England with the
Conqueror, was the first lord of the barony of Kendal, and
brother of Fulk, Earl of Anjou and King of Jerusalem.
Ketel, the grandson of Ivo, had two sons;&mdash;Gilbert, the
father of William de Lancaster, from whom descended, in a
direct line, the barons of Kendal; and Orme, from whom
descended the Curwens. These took their surname by
agreement from Culwen, a family of Galloway, whose heir
they married. It is said, that Culwen, which is on the seacoast
of Galloway, had its name from a neighbouring rock,
which was thought to resemble a white monk; that being the
meaning of the word in the Irish language. It is also said,
that the family name was changed to Curwen, by a corruption,
which first appeared in the public records in the reign of
King Henry VI. Orme having espoused Gunilda, sister of
Waldieve, first lord of Allerdale, received in marriage with
her the manor of Seaton below Derwent, and took up his
abode there. Their son, Gospatrick, received the manors of
Workington and Lamplugh from William de Lancaster in
exchange for Middleton, in Westmorland. He was succeeded
by his son Thomas, who became lord of Culwen in
Galloway, and died in 1152, and was buried in the Abbey of
Shap, to which he had been a benefactor; his estates descending
to his second son, Patric de Culwen, who removed
his residence from Seaton to Workington, where his descendants
have since remained.</p>

<p>Sir Thomas Curwen, the seventh in descent from Patric,
died in the thirty fourth year of Henry VIII. In reference to
this member of the family, Sandford in his M.S. History of
Cumberland relates an instance of the pleasant manner in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>which conventual property at the dissolution was dealt with,
and disposed of, among that monarch's favourites and friends.
It is thus given:&mdash;"Sir Tho. Curwen Knight in Henry
the Eight's time, an excellent archer at twelve score merks:
And went up with his men to shoote with that reknowned
King at the dissolution of abbeis: And the King says to him,
Curwen, why doth thee begg none of thes Abbeis: I wold
gratifie the some way: Quoth the other, thank yow, and afterward
said he wold desire of him the Abbie of ffurness (nye unto
him) for 20 ty one years: Sayes the King, take it for ever:
Quoth the other, its long enough, for youle set them up
againe in that time: But they not likely to be set up againe,
this Sir Tho. Curwen sent Mr. Preston who had married his
daughter to renew the lease for him; and he even renneued
in his owne name; which when his father in law questioned,
quoth Mr. Preston, yow shall have it as long as yow live:
and I thinke I may as well have it with your daughter as
another."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>There is probably some truth in the anecdote, related
by Sandford. For it is said by West, that not long after
the dissolution of Monasteries, Thomas Preston, of Preston-Patrick
and Levens, purchased the site and immediate
grounds of Furness Abbey from the trustees of the crown,
with other considerable estates to the value of £3000 a year:
after which he removed from Preston-Patrick, and resided at
the Abbey, in a manor house built on the spot where the Abbot's
apartments stood. Of his two sons, John the elder married
the daughter of Curwen. His descendants were called
Prestons of the Abbey, and of the Manor; and continued for
four generations, when the two great grandsons of the
purchaser died without issue. The family of Christopher,
his second son, were known as the Prestons of Holker. Of
these, Catharine, the fifth in the direct line from Christopher,
was the mother of Sir Thomas Lowther, Baronet, of Yorkshire,
to whom on the failure of the elder branch, the property
of the Prestons in Furness was granted by George the First.
This gentleman, by his marriage with the Lady Elizabeth
Cavendish, daughter of the Duke of Devonshire, had an only
son and heir, Sir William Lowther, Baronet, the last descendant
of the Prestons of Preston-Patrick, who died unmarried
in 1756, bequeathing all his estates in Furness and Cartmel to
his cousin Lord George Augustus Cavendish, through whom
they passed by inheritance to the present Duke of Devonshire.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>In a report to the government of Queen Elizabeth, of the
date of 1588, inserted among the Burghley Papers, the son
and heir of this sharp-handed son-in-law of Curwen is mentioned
in somewhat detractory terms, in a passage which describes
"the Pylle of Folder," or Pile of Fouldrey. "The same
Pylle is an old decayed castell of 'the dowchie of Lancaster,
in Furness Felles, where one Thomas Preestone (a Papyshe
Atheiste) is depute steward, and comaunders the menrede
and lands ther, which were sometime members appertayninge
to the Abbeye of Furnes.'"</p>

<p>Workington Hall, the seat of the Curwens, is a large
quadrangular building, with battlemented parapets, situated
on a woody acclivity over looking the river Derwent, at the east
end of the town. It has been almost entirely rebuilt within
the present century. The old mansion was castellated pursuant
to the royal license granted by Richard II., in 1379, to
Sir Gilbert de Culwen. It is remarkable for having been the
first prison-house of the unfortunate Mary of Scotland, after
she had landed within the dominions of her rival. Having
left the Scottish shore in a small fishing boat, she landed with
about twenty attendants near the Hall on Sunday, May 16th,
1568; and was received by Sir Henry Curwen as became her
rank and misfortunes, and hospitably entertained by him, till
she removed to Cockermouth, on her route to Carlisle. The
apartment in which the Queen had slept was long preserved,
out of respect to her memory, as she had left it. But some
recent alterations of the mansion having become necessary, it
was found that these could not be effected without the destruction
of that portion which had been so long distinguished
as the Queen's Chamber.</p>

<p>Mr. Denton, who wrote about the year 1676, says, "I do
not know any seat in all Britain so commodiously situated for
beauty, plenty, and pleasure as this is." And Mr. Sandford,
who wrote about the same time, has the following rapturous
description, "And a very fair mansion-house and pallace-like;
a court of above 60 yards long and 40 yards broad, built
round about; garretted turret-wise, and toors in the corner;
a gate house, and most wainscot and gallery roomes; and
the brave prospect of seas and ships almost to the house,
the tides flowing up. Brave orchards, gardens, dovecoats,
and woods and grounds in the bank about, and brave corn
fields and meadows below, as like as Chelsay fields. And now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>the habitation of a brave young Sq. his father Monsir Edward
Curwen, and his mother the grandchild of Sir Michael
Wharton o' th' Wolds in Yorkshire."</p>

<p>Even Mr. Gilpin, a century later, was struck with "its
hanging woods and sloping lawns," and speaks of its situation
as "one of the grandest and most beautiful in the country."</p>

<p>The anecdote upon which the poem is founded was related
by a person who about fifty years ago was much acquainted
with what was current in some of the principal families in the
West of Cumberland. She stated that it was commonly
repeated among the servants of the different houses, and was
quite credited by them: and that she herself had not any
doubt as to the truth of the story, but could not give the
period to which the circumstances refer.</p>

<p>One of the domestics of the Hall was said to have been
surprised by her master in the manner described, and to have
been overheard by him, uttering the words,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Who knows what may happen, or what may befall?<br />
I may be Lady of Workington Hall!"<br />
</div>

<p>The butler was instructed to repeat the words publicly in the
presence of the Maid, who fled from the mansion, overwhelmed
with confusion. She subsequently formed a matrimonial
alliance with a principal member of the family; and
thus in a manner her prediction was verified.</p>

<p>Such was the story, and such the narrator. It may be
added, that the published notices of the family are devoid of
anything to give confirmation to the story; but as it was
related in the neighbourhood in the spirit alluded to, a place
has been given to it among the traditions of Cumberland.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE ALTAR ON CROSS-FELL.<br />
(FORMERLY FIENDS'-FELL.)</h2>

<div class="poem">
Come listen and hear of the Fiends'-Fell dread;<br />
And the helm of storm that shrouds its head,<br />
When the imps and cubs of Evil that tread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Its summit, their strifes are waging:</span><br />
Who made their haunt on its topmost height,<br />
And down the valleys came often by night,<br />
To affright the Shepherds, the herds to blight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And set the strong winds raging.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, dwellers in peaceful vales afar!<br />
The cloudy Helm and the dismal Bar&mdash;<br />
You know whose work on the Fell they are;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And you know whose wort they are brewing.</span><br />
And you wish that the saintly Augustine<br />
A warier man on his errand had been,<br />
When the lizard crept into his chalice unseen,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The power of his spells undoing.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span><br />
For he came, by good men sought, they say,<br />
To the Fiends'-Fell foot, a weary way,<br />
To chase the fiends from the cloud that lay<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On its summit, as if to hide it.</span><br />
At an hour unmarked, by paths unknown,<br />
He climbed up the mountain side alone,<br />
And built on the top an altar of stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And reared the cross beside it.</span><br />
<br />
And there within that mighty cloud,<br />
Where wrathful spirits were raging loud,<br />
The old good man, with mind unbow'd,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But body so oft-times bending,</span><br />
Moved to and fro on the haunted top,<br />
And gathered the stones from off the slope,<br />
Nor bated a jot of heart or hope<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While the Altar pile was ascending.</span><br />
<br />
Then while the sun made bright below<br />
And warmed the vales with its cheerful glow,<br />
The mighty cloud began to blow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And deafening cries flew round him.</span><br />
But still the altar on high begun<br />
With heart and will, from his labours done<br />
The crowning recompence now has won<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For him, to that end who bound him.</span><br />
<br />
There stands the Altar the saint before.<br />
The long laborious task is o'er.<br />
The Cross which once the victim bore,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It too spreads wide its arms.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>The Chalice is there with the juice divine;<br />
The wafer that bares the sacred sign;<br />
And the tapers beside the Cross to shine;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To work out the counter-charms.</span><br />
<br />
All ready beside the holy man<br />
Stood&mdash;when for a moment his eyes began<br />
To droop, and a feeling of slumber ran<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through his veins oppress'd and weary.</span><br />
For toil an old man's limbs will shake:<br />
And toil an old man's frame will break:<br />
But, that instant past, he stands awake<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Within that cloud so dreary.</span><br />
<br />
It was enough: No counter-charm<br />
Might work that day the fiend-cubs harm.<br />
The Chalice he offers with outstretched arm<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Has a reptile form within it!</span><br />
And neither the saint nor the wine has power<br />
To banish one fiend from the Fell, that hour:<br />
For a lizard the edge of the chalice crept o'er,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While he slept but that tithe of a minute.</span><br />
<br />
Then blew the fiends, as if they would blow<br />
The mountain itself to the plain below.<br />
And when the saint turned round to go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Down tumbled the Altar behind him:</span><br />
And boiled and seethed the Helm and Bar,<br />
And the winds rushed down on the valleys afar;<br />
While the Saint emerged, like a shining star,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">From the cloud where they could not bind him.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span><br />
And he went his way; and the fiends prevailed.<br />
And still is the mountain by fiends assailed.<br />
And the dismal Helm from afar is hailed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As a tempest surely growing.</span><br />
The herdsman shudders, and hies away<br />
To his hut on the hills at close of day,<br />
For he knows whose cubs are abroad at play<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And setting the Helm wind blowing.</span><br />
<br />
His children mourn at the dolorous roar,<br />
And rush to his arms from hearth and floor.<br />
But the good man thinks of his stacks and store,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His fields and his farmstead wasting.</span><br />
The housewife prays that the rain may fall:<br />
But the stars are shining high over all:<br />
And the Bar extends like a pitchy wall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the West, where the storm is hasting.</span><br />
<br />
The long loud roar, it deepens amain;<br />
And down from the Helm along valley and plain<br />
Goes the wind with invisible hosts in its train,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And they mount the black Bar-cloud appalling;</span><br />
And they heave it and row it, those mariners dread,<br />
For days, till it anchors on Fiends'-Fell head:<br />
Then the big drops pour from the skies o'er spread,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the torrents to torrents are calling.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE ALTAR ON CROSS-FELL."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The Editor of Camden (Bishop Gibson), speaking of huge
stones found together on the top of steep and high mountains,
thought they might possibly be the ruins of Churches
or Chapels which had been built there. "For," says
he, "it was thought an extraordinary piece of devotion, upon
the planting of Christianity in these parts, to erect crosses,
and build chapels on the most eminent places, as being both
nearer heaven and more conspicuous: they were commonly
dedicated to St. Michael. That large tract of mountains on
the east side of the county (of Cumberland), called Cross-Fells,
had the name given them upon that account; for before,
they were called Fiends'-Fell, or Devil's Fell; and Dilston, a
small town under them, is contracted from Devil's-town."</p>

<p>Among the several monuments on the pavement in the
cross-aisle in Hexham Cathedral, is one ornamented with a
crosier, and inscribed, "Hic Jacet Thomas de Devilston."</p>

<p>The mountain, Cross-Fell, which is remarkable for the
phenomenon of the Helm-Cloud upon its summit, and the
Helm-wind, as it is called, generated within it, which is
sometimes productive of such destructive effects in the valleys
below, is said to have been formerly designated Fiends'-Fell,
from the common belief that evil spirits had their haunt upon
it; until St. Augustine, to whom and his forty followers,
when travelling on their missionary labours in these parts, a
legendary tradition ascribes the expulsion of the demons of
the storms, erected a <i>Cross</i>, and built an altar on the summit,
where he offered the holy eucharist, and thus was supposed to
have counter-charmed the demons. Since that time it has
borne the name of Cross-Fell; and the people of the neighbourhood
style a heap of stones lying there, the Altar upon
Cross-Fell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<p>The common saying, "Its brewing a storm," or "A storm
is brewing," is one of the many phrases in which we only repeat
the thought of our primeval Scandinavian ancestors;
amongst whom the beverage quaffed in the halls of Valhalla,
the drink of the Gods, was conceived to be a product of the
storm, and had more or less identity with the Cloud-Water.
In Germany, the mists that gather about the mountain tops
before a storm are said to be accounted for in like manner, as
if they were steam from the brewing or boiling in which
dwarfs, elves, or witches were engaged. Such modes of expression,
according to the dictionary of the brothers Grimm,
are of extreme antiquity.</p>

<p>Some such ideas seem to have been popularly associated
with that enormous cloud, which is often seen, like a helmet,
to cover the summit of Cross-Fell, and in which the Helm-Wind
is generated.</p>

<p>In speaking of the Helm-Wind, it may be necessary to premise
that Cross-Fell is one continued ridge, stretching without
any branches, or even subject mountains, except two or three
conical hills called Pikes, from the N.N.W. to the S.S.E.,
from the neighbourhood of Gilsland almost to Kirkby-Stephen,
that is about forty miles. Its direction is nearly in a right
line, and the height of its different parts not very unequal;
but is in general such, that some of its more eminent parts are
exceeded in altitude by few hills in Britain, being 2901 feet
above the level of the sea. The slope to the summit from the
east is gradual, and extends over perhaps fifty miles of country;
whilst on the west it is abrupt, and has at five miles from its
base the river Eden running parallel to the mountain.</p>

<p>Upon the upper part of this lofty ridge, there often rests, in
dry and sunny weather, a prodigious wreath of clouds, extending
from three or four to sixteen or eighteen miles each way,
north and south, from the highest point; it is at times above
the mountain, sometimes it rests upon its top, but most frequently
descends a considerable way down its side. This
mighty collection of vapour, from which so much commotion
issues, exhibits an appearance uncommonly grand and solemn;
and is named from a Saxon word, which in our language implies
a covering, the Helm. The western front of this
enormous cloud is clearly defined, and quite separated from
any other cloud on that side. Opposite to this, and at a variable
distance towards the west, and at the same elevation, is
another cloud with its eastern edge as clearly defined as the
Helm; this is called the Bar or Bur. It is said to have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>appearance of being in continual motion, as if boiling, or at
least agitated by a violent wind.</p>

<p>The distance between the Helm and the Bar varies as the
Bar advances towards, or recedes from, the Helm; this is sometimes
not more than half a mile, sometimes three or four miles,
and occasionally the Bar seems to coincide with the western
horizon; or it disperses and there is no Bar, and then there is
a general east wind extending over all the country westward.</p>

<p>The description of this remarkable phenomenon, the Helm-Wind,
we will give from observations made by the Rev. John
Watson, of Cumrew, and others. The places most subject to
it are Milburn, Kirkland, Ousby, Melmerby, and Gamblesby.
Sometimes when the atmosphere is quite settled, hardly a
cloud to be seen, and not a breath of wind stirring, a small
cloud appears on the summit of the mountain, and extends
itself to the north and south; the Helm is then said to be on,
and in a few minutes the wind is blowing so violently as to
break down trees, overthrow stacks, occasionally blow a person
from his horse, or overturn a horse and cart. When the
wind blows, the Helm seems violently agitated; and on
descending the fell and entering it, there is not much wind.
Sometimes a Helm forms and goes off without a wind; and
there are easterly winds without a Helm. The open space
between the Helm and Bar varies from eight or ten to thirty
or forty miles in length, and from half a mile to four or six
miles in breadth; it is of an elliptical form, as the Helm and
Bar are united at the ends. A representation of the Helm,
Bar, and space between, may be made by opening the forefinger
and thumb of each hand, and placing their tips to each
other; the thumbs will then represent the Helm on the top of
the fell, the forefingers the Bar, and the space between, the
variable limits of the wind.</p>

<p>The open space is clear of clouds with the exception of
small pieces breaking off now and then from the Helm, and
either disappearing or being driven rapidly over the Bar; but
through this open space is often seen a high stratum of clouds
quite at rest. Within the space described the wind blows
continually; it has been known to do so for nine days together,
the Bar advancing or receding to different distances.
When heard or felt for the first time it does not seem so very
extraordinary; but when heard or felt for days together, it
gives a strong impression of sublimity. Its sound is peculiar,
and when once known is easily distinguished from that of
ordinary winds; it cannot be heard more than three or four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>miles, but in the wind or near it, it is grand and awful, and
has been compared to the noise made by the sea in a violent
storm.</p>

<p>Its first effect on the spirits is exhilarating, and it gives a
buoyancy to the body. The country subject to it is very
healthy, but it does great injury to vegetation by beating
grain, grass, and leaves of trees, till quite black.</p>

<p>It may further be remarked of this wind, that it is very
irregular, rarely occurring in the summer months, and more
frequent from the end of September to May. It generally
blows from Cross-Fell longest in the spring, when the sun has
somewhat warmed the earth beneath, and does not cease till
it has effectually cooled it; thus it sometimes continues,
according to Mr. Ritson, for a fortnight or three weeks, which
he considers a peculiarity of the Helm wind of Cross-Fell.
The wind itself is very chill, and is almost always terminated
by a rain, which restores, or to which succeeds, a general
warmth, and into which the Helm seems to resolve itself.</p>

<p>The best explanation of this very interesting and remarkable
phenomenon is given in the following observations of Dr. T.
Barnes of Carlisle.</p>

<p>The air or wind from the east ascends the gradual slope of
the eastern side of the Penine chain or Cross-Fell range of
mountains, to the summit of Cross-Fell, where it enters the
Helm or cap, and is cooled to a low temperature; it then
rushes forcibly down the abrupt declivity of the western side of
the mountain into the valley beneath, in consequence of the
valley being of a warmer temperature, and this constitutes the
Helm wind.</p>

<p>The sudden and violent rushing of the wind down the
ravines and crevices of the mountains occasions the loud noise
that is heard.</p>

<p>At a varying distance from the base of the mountain the
Helm wind is rarified by the warmth of the low ground, and
meets with the wind from the west, which resists its further
course. The higher temperature it has acquired in the valley,
and the meeting of the contrary current, occasion it to rebound
and ascend into the upper region of the atmosphere. When
the air or wind has reached the height of the Helm, it is again
cooled to the low temperature of this cold region, and is consequently
unable to support the same quantity of vapour it
had in the valley; the water or moisture contained in the air,
is therefore condensed by the cold, and forms the cloud called
the Helm-Bar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>The meeting of the opposing currents beneath,&mdash;where there
are frequently strong gusts of wind from all quarters, and the
sudden condensation of the air and moisture in the Bar-cloud,
give rise to its agitation or commotion, as if "struggling with
contrary blasts." The Bar is therefore not the cause of the
limit of the Helm wind, but is the consequence of it. It is
absurd to suppose that the Bar, which is a light cloud, can
impede or resist the Helm wind; but if it even possessed a
sufficient resisting power, it could have no influence on the
wind which is blowing near the surface of the earth, and which
might pass under the Bar.</p>

<p>The variable distance of the Bar from the Helm is owing to
the changing situation of the opposing and conflicting currents,
and the difference of temperature of different parts of the low
ground near the base of the mountain.</p>

<p>When there is a break or opening in the Bar, the wind is
said to rush through with great violence, and to extend over
the country. Here again, the effect is mistaken for the
cause. In this case, the Helm-Wind, which blows always
from the east, has, in some places underneath the observed
opening, overcome the resistance of the air, or of the wind
from the west, and of course does not rebound and ascend into
the higher regions to form the Bar. The supply being cut
off, a break or opening in that part of the Bar necessarily
takes place.</p>

<p>When the temperature of the lower region has fallen and
become nearly uniform with that of the mountain range, the
Helm wind ceases; the Bar and the Helm approach and join
each other, and rain not unfrequently follows.</p>

<p>When the Helm-Wind has overcome all the resistance of
the lower atmosphere, or of the opposing current from the
west, and the temperature of the valley and of the mountain is
more nearly equalized, there is no rebound or ascent of the
wind, consequently the Bar ceases to be formed, the one
already existing is dissipated, and a general east wind
prevails.</p>

<p>There is little wind in the Helm-cloud, because the air is
colder in it than in the valley, and the moisture which the
air contains is more condensed and is deposited in the cloud
upon the summit of the mountain.</p>

<p>There is rarely either a Helm, Helm-wind, or Bar, during
the summer, on account of the higher temperature of the summit
of the Cross-Fell range, and the upper regions of the
atmosphere, at that season of the year.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>The different situations of the Helm, on the side, on the
summit, and above the mountain, will depend on the
temperature of these places: when the summit is not cold
enough to condense the vapour, the Helm is situated higher
in a colder region, and will descend down the side of the
mountains if the temperature be sufficiently low to produce
that effect.</p>

<p>The sky is clear between the Helm and Bar, because the
air below is warmer and can support a greater quantity of
vapour rising from the surface of the earth, and this vapour
is driven forward by the Helm-Wind, and ascends up in the
rebound to the Bar. In short, the Helm is merely a cloud or
cap upon the mountain, the cold air descends from the
Helm to the valley, and constitutes the Helm Wind, and
when warmed and rarified in the valley, ascends and forms
the Bar.</p></blockquote>

<h2>WILLIE O' SCALES.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Said Willie o' Scales, at break of day,<br />
"The hunt's up! I must busk and away!<br />
Steed, good wife? and saddle? I trow,<br />
Willie o' Scales is steed enow."<br />
<br />
&mdash;Scotland's King is a hunting gone:<br />
Willie o' Scales, he runs alone:<br />
Knights and Nobles many a score:<br />
Hounds full twenty tongues and more.<br />
<br />
Through the covert the deer he sprang:<br />
Over the heather the music rang.<br />
Dogs and steeds well speeded they:<br />
But Willie o' Scales, he show'd the way.<br />
<br />
For speed of foot had Willie no peer.<br />
He outstripp'd the horses, dogs, and deer.<br />
He left the Nobles far behind.<br />
He pass'd the King like a puff of wind.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span><br />
At the close of day, with a greenwood bough,<br />
Beside the deer he fann'd his brow.<br />
And "There, my liege!" to the Monarch he said,<br />
"Is as gallant a stag as ever lay dead.<br />
<br />
"I count him fleet, for a stag of ten!"&mdash;<br />
&mdash;"And I count thee chief of my Border men.<br />
No gallanter heart, I dare be sworn,<br />
Ever drew the shaft or wound the horn.<br />
<br />
"No trustier hand than thine was found<br />
When foes to Scotland hemm'd us round.<br />
Now swifter of foot than our fleetest deer&mdash;<br />
We'll try thy hold upon land and gear.<br />
<br />
"For his speed in sport, for his might in fray,<br />
Write, '<span class="smcap">Gill's</span> broad lands' to 'Willie, <span class="smcap">the Rae</span>!'<br />
And for ever a Willie the Rae be here,<br />
When the King comes by to hunt the deer."&mdash;<br />
<br />
Thus spoke King William, where he stood,<br />
The Lion of Scotland, fierce of mood.<br />
And musing turned, and look'd again<br />
On his Border vassal; and cross'd the plain.<br />
<br />
Centuries long have rolled away:<br />
The Monarch is dust, his Nobles clay:<br />
Old lines are changed, are changing still:<br />
But Willie the Rae is lord of Gill.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "WILLIE O' SCALES."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The long and scattered hamlet of High and Low Scales,
is on the west side of Crummock Beck, near Bromfield, and
a few miles from Wigton in Cumberland. Skells or scales,
from a Saxon or Gothic word signifying a cover, was the
name given to those slight temporary huts made of turf
or sods which in the mountainous district of this county and
Scotland are called Bields. They were erected most commonly
for the shelter of shepherds; and during the later periods,
in the border wars to protect the persons who were appointed
to watch the cattle of the neighbourhood. Few estates in
the kingdom have belonged to one family longer than this
of <span class="smcap">The Gill</span>, which was formerly, however, much more
extensive, comprising most probably the neighbouring hamlet
of Scales. Another somewhat uncommon circumstance
belonging to it is, that, to the close of last century, and
for anything we know to the contrary, to a much later date,
the owner had always lived on and occupied it himself; it
had never been in the hands of a farmer.</p>

<p>The Reays of Gill, however variously their name has been
spelled and pronounced by different branches of the family,
derived it from one on whom it was undoubtedly bestowed as
being characteristical and descriptive of himself. The active
hunter, the companion and the friend of William the Lion,
was called in the commoner Saxon language of his time Ra,
or Raa, a Roe, from his unparalleled swiftness. In Scotland
and Germany a roe is still pronounced rae, as it was
formerly in England.</p>

<div class="poem">
"When the deer and the rae<br />
Lightly bounding together,<br />
Sport the lang simmer day<br />
On the braes of Balquhither."<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>The tradition is that the head, or chief, of this family had a
grant of the lands of Gill to him, and his heirs for ever, from
William the Lion, King of Scotland, whose eventful reign
lasted nearly half a century; and who died in 1214. This
grant is said to have been made, not only as a reward for his
fidelity to his prince, but as a memorial of his extraordinary
swiftness of foot in pursuing the deer, outstripping in fleetness
most of the horses and dogs. The conditions of the grants
were, that he should pay a pepper corn yearly, as an acknowledgment,
and that the name of William should, if
possible, be perpetuated in the family. "And this is certain,"
says a writer in the Gentleman's Magazine about the year
1794, "That ever since, till now, a William Reay has been
owner of the Gill. There is every reason to believe that the
present John Reay is the first instance of a deviation." It is
said that even in that instance the deviation was not made
without deliberation; William the father having first consulted
an eminent lawyer, whether he might safely call his
son John. It was replied that mere length of occupancy would
quiet the possession and make the title good.</p>

<p>The great military tenure of lands in this district was by
<span class="smcap">HOMAGE</span>, <span class="smcap">FEALTY</span> and <span class="smcap">CORNAGE</span>. This last (cornage) drew after
it <i>wardship</i>, <i>marriage</i>, and <i>relief</i>. And the service of this tenure
was <i>knight's service</i>. <span class="smcap">Homage</span> was the most honourable
service, and the most humble service of reverence, that a free
tenant can do to his lord. For when he was to do homage
to his lord, he was to appear ungirt, bareheaded, without his
sword, and, kneeling on both knees, his hands held out and
clasped between his lord's, was to say&mdash;"I become your man
from this day forward of life, and limb, and earthly honour, and
unto you will be true and faithful, and faith unto you will
bear for the tenements that I claim to hold of you, saving the
faith that I owe to our Sovereign Lord the King." And then
the lord so sitting was to kiss him; by which kiss he was
bound to be his vassal for ever.</p>

<p>When a free tenant was to do <span class="smcap">FEALTY</span> to his lord, he was to
hold his right hand upon a book, and say thus&mdash;"Know ye
this, my lord, that I will be faithful and true to you, and faith
to you will bear for the tenements which I claim to hold of
you, and that I will lawfully do to you the customs and
services which I ought to do at the terms assigned; so
help me God and his Saints." But he was not to kneel,
nor make such humble reverence as in homage; and fealty
might be done before the steward of the court, but homage
could only be done to the lord himself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Cornage</span>, called also <span class="smcap">HORNGELD</span>, and <span class="smcap">NOWTEGELD</span> or (cow-tax)
seems early to have been converted into a pecuniary fine,
being a stipulated payment in the first instance for the finding
of scouts or horners to procure intelligence. It was first paid
in cattle. The tenants who held by cornage were bound to
be always ready to serve the King and lord of the manor on
horseback, or on foot, at their own charge; and when the
King's army marched into Scotland, their post was in the
vanguard as they advanced, and in the vanguard on their
return. Because they best knew the passes and defiles, and
the way and manner of the enemy's attacking and retreating.
<i>Wardship</i> and <i>marriage</i> were included in this tenure. When
the tenant died, and the heir male was within the age of
twenty one years, the lord was to have the land holden of him
until the heir should attain that age; because the heir by
intendment of law was not able to do knight's service before
his age of twenty-one years. And if such heir was not
married at the time of the death of his ancestor, then the lord
was to have the wardship and marriage of him. But if the
tenant died leaving an heir female, which heir female was of
the age of fourteen years or upwards, then the lord was not
to have the wardship of the land, nor of the body; because a
woman of that age might have a husband to do knight's
service. But if such heir female was under the age of fourteen
years, and unmarried at the time of the death of her ancestor,
the lord was to have the wardship of the land holden of him
until the age of such heir female of fourteen years; within
which time the lord might tender unto her convenable
marriage without disparagement; and if the lord did not
tender such marriage within the said age, she might have
entered into the lands, and ousted the lord.</p>

<p>Thus the consent of a superior lord was requisite for the
marriage of a female vassal; and this power was distorted
into the right of disposing of the ward in marriage. When
the King or lord was in want of money it was by no means
unusual to offer the wards, male or female, with their lands,
in a sense to the highest bidder. If the ward refused to fulfil
the marriage so made, then a sum was due from the estates
equal to what they would have fetched.</p>

<p><i>Relief</i> was a certain sum of money, that the heir, on coming
of age, paid unto the lord, on taking possession of the inheritance
of his ancestor.</p>

<p>A <i>Knight's fee</i> was estimated, not according to the quality
but the quantity of the land, about 640 acres; and the relief
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>was after the rate of one fourth part of the yearly value of the
fee.</p>

<p>The <i>lord's rent</i> was called <i>white money</i>, or <i>white rent</i>, from
its being paid in silver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scutage</span> or service of the shield, was another compensation
in money, instead of personal service against the Scots.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">DRENGAGE</span> tenure, which prevailed about Brougham and
Clifton, was extremely servile. The tenants seem to have
been drudges to perform the most laborious and servile offices.
Dr. Burn quotes authority to prove that Sir Hugh de Morville
in Westmorland changed drengage into free service; and
that Gilbert de Brougham gave one half of the village of
Brougham to Robert de Veteripont to make the other half
free of drengage. One of the de Threlkelds also, who
lived at Yanwath Hall, in the time of Edward I., relieved his
tenants at Threlkeld of servile burdens at four pence a head.
The services were half a draught for one day's ploughing; one
day's mowing; one of shearing; one of clipping; one of
salving sheep; one carriage load in two years, not to go
above ten miles; to dig and load two loads of peat every year&mdash;the
tenants to have their crowdy (a coarse mess of meal,
dripping and hot water) while they worked; the cottagers the
same, only they found a horse and harrow instead of the half
plough, and a footman's load, not a carriage load.</p>

<p>Many of these have long been lost sight of; and now
most of the lands, whether held on customary or arbitrary
tenures, merely pay an almost nominal rent, besides certain
fines, to the lord of the manor. Nevertheless there is much
truth in what Blackstone says: that "copy holders are only
villeins improved."</p>

<p>Lands of arbitrary tenure pay, with certain deductions,
fines of two years value on the death of lord or tenant, or of
both, and on alienation. Some pay dower to the widow;
others do not. Some pay a live heriot, which means the best
animal in the tenant's possession; others, a dead heriot,
that is, the most valuable implement, or piece of furniture.
In Catholic times, the Church also, on some manors, claimed
as heriot the second best animal the tenant might die
possessed of, and on others the best. In some instances a
heriot is only payable when a widow remains in possession
of the tenement, and in these cases the original object of the
impost was to recompense the lord of the manor for the loss
of a man's military service during the widow's occupancy. In
some joint manors where two, or perhaps three, lords have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>claims for heriots, very discreditable, and, to a dying tenant's
family, very distressing scenes are enacted; for, when it becomes
known that the holder of a tenement so burdened is on
his death-bed, the stewards of the several manors place
watches round the premises, who ascertain what and where
the best animal may be, and, as soon as the demise of the
tenant is announced, a rush ensues, and an unseemly contest
for possession.</p>

<p>In arbitrary lands some lords claim all the timber; others
only the oak; others the oak and yew; others oak and white
thorn; and so on. In some the tenant is bound to plant two
trees of the same kind for every one he fells; but tenants have
a right to timber for repairs, rebuilding, or implements,
though they must not cut down without license. Many lands
are bound to carry their grain to the manorial mill to be
ground and <i>multured</i>; but this custom has fallen into disuse.
Most lords retain the minerals and game if they enfranchise
the soil, as many have done.</p>

<p>Many lands used to pay boons of various kinds; and some
of these services are still enforced. By these were demanded
so many men or boys, horses, carts, &amp;c., in peat cutting
time, hay time, harvest, wood-cutting and carting, and so on.
In Martindale Chace, near Ulswater, where Mr. Hasell has
a herd of that now rare species, the Red Deer, the tenants
are bound to attend the lord's hunt once a year, which is called
on their court roll a <i>Boon Hunt</i>. On this occasion, they each
held their district allotted on the boundaries of the Chace,
where they are stationed, to prevent the stag flying beyond
the liberty. In the east of Cumberland, the tenants were
obliged to send horses and sacks to St. Bees, for salt for the
lord's use; some had to bring their own provisions when engaged
in these services: some were entitled to a cake of a
stated size for each man, and a smaller for a boy, on assembling
in the morning at a fixed hour, under a certain tree, as was
the custom at Irton Hall. Breach of punctuality forfeited
this cake, but the work was always exacted. Certain farms in
some manors were bound to maintain male animals for the
use of all the tenants, subject to various conditions and regulations.
Formerly many tenants paid a pound of pepper at
the lord's court; others only a pepper-corn; and some lands
are still held by this custom.</p>

<p>Many other peculiar customs connected with the tenure of
land formerly existed.</p>

<p>Curious individual exemptions from certain burthens are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>be met with occasionally. In the parish of Renwick a copyholder
is released from payment of the prescription in lieu of
tithe, paid by all his neighbours, because one of his ancestors
slew "a cock-a-trice." This monster is alleged to have been
nothing more than a bat of extraordinary size, which terrified
the people in church one evening, so that all fled save the
clerk, who valiantly giving battle, succeeded in striking it
down with his staff. For this exploit, which is stated to have
taken place about 260 years ago, he was rewarded with the
exemption mentioned, which is still claimed by his successors.</p>

<p>In the parish of Castle-Sowerby, the ten principal estates
were anciently called <i>Red Spears</i>, on account of the singular
service by which the tenants held them, viz:&mdash;that of riding
through the town of Penrith on Whit-Tuesday, brandishing
their spears. Those who held by this tenure were of the
order of Red Knights, mentioned in our law books; a name
derived from the Saxon, who held their lands by serving the
lord on horseback. <i>Delient equitare cum domino suo de manerio
in manerium, vel cum domini uxore.</i> In times of peace,
it is presumed they held the annual service above noted as a
challenge to the enemies of their country, or those who might
dispute the title of their lord, similar to the parade of the
Champion of England at a coronation. The spears were
about nine feet in length, and till within the last century,
some of them remained in the proprietors' houses, where they
were usually deposited; and were sureties to the sheriff for
the peaceable behaviour of the rest of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The ancient owners of the Red Spears estates annually
served as jurors at the forest court held near Hesket, on St.
Barnabas Day, by which they were exempted from all parish
offices.</p></blockquote>

<h2>ERMENGARDE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
It was the early summer time,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When Maidens stint their praying</span><br />
To wander forth at morning's prime,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With happy hearts, a maying;</span><br />
To wash their rosy cheeks with dew,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And roam the meadows over:</span><br />
And ask the winds to tell them true<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of some far distant lover.</span><br />
<br />
Then little Ermengarde, the while<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To graver thoughts awaking,</span><br />
Look'd sadly on St. Herbert's Isle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As morn was brightly breaking.</span><br />
Some tapestry for his altar wrought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beside her bed was lying;</span><br />
Her beads, and little scroll for thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No conscious look descrying.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span><br />
And now when might the gentle Saint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be at his service bending;</span><br />
His earnest life, without a taint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of earth still heavenwards tending&mdash;</span><br />
His silver voice, oft heard in prayer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or in direction pleading&mdash;</span><br />
His manhood's bright angelic air&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her thought too fond were feeding.</span><br />
<br />
In little Ermengarde her love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With God the Saint divided.</span><br />
Unknown even to herself she wove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The threads her passion guided.</span><br />
And when she trembled on her knees<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Confessing faith before him&mdash;</span><br />
Ah! can this be but Man she sees,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So heart and soul adore him!</span><br />
<br />
So little Ermengarde with pale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And thoughtful cheek sat sighing,</span><br />
When rode an Elf-man down the vale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her open lattice eyeing.</span><br />
"Good morrow! May my Lady's thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This happy May-day, blossom;</span><br />
And tenfold blessedness be wrought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Within that gentle bosom!"</span><br />
<br />
"My tongue no thought or wish express'd"&mdash;<br />
&mdash;"Yet, trust me, fairest Lady!"<br />
"In Bowscale tarn, for thy behest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The undying twain are ready.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>Ask from their breasts two tiny scales<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of gold and pearly whiteness.</span><br />
These on thy heart&mdash;fulfill'd prevails<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy wish in all its brightness!"&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
The stranger pass'd. Away she hies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mountain pathway keeping,</span><br />
Where deep amid the silence lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gloomy water sleeping.</span><br />
"Come, faithful fishes! give to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two little scales"&mdash;she chanted&mdash;</span><br />
That in my bosom peace may be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all my wishes granted."&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
They gave her from their pearly sides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two little scales. She bore them</span><br />
Down from the hill the Tarn that hides,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in her bosom wore them.</span><br />
The simple Cross her mother gave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was on her neck, a token</span><br />
Of that pure faith to which she clave;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But lo! the link was broken!</span><br />
<br />
Down Greta's side with wild delight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little Maiden wandered;</span><br />
And on the Saint before her sight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her inmost sight, she pondered;</span><br />
Now thinking&mdash;O that wed with mine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His holy heart were moving!</span><br />
How shall we soar in thoughts divine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How walk in pathways loving!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span><br />
It was a festal day, and bands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of youths and maids were trooping</span><br />
With flowers and offerings in their hands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And round the altar grouping.</span><br />
And hark the little bell! it calls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To every heart how sweetly!</span><br />
But most on Ermengarde's it falls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With joy that brings her fleetly.</span><br />
<br />
But on the stony river's brim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A moment's space delaying,</span><br />
To gaze&mdash;before she look'd on him&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On her own features playing</span><br />
Within the mirror'd pool below&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Its broken link dissevering,</span><br />
Her little Cross fell sinking slow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond her vain endeavouring.</span><br />
<br />
And from the stream two fin-like arms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leapt up and snatch'd her wailing,</span><br />
And dragg'd her down with all her charms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In anguish unavailing.</span><br />
And down the rocks they bore her fast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With struggles unrelenting:</span><br />
And Greta's roar mix'd in the blast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With Ermengarde's lamenting.</span><br />
<br />
And far adown the rushing tide<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was dragg'd and whirled the Maiden;</span><br />
And wildly mid the pools she cried<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In accents horror-laden.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>The streams dash'd on with furious roar;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No aid the rude rocks lent her;</span><br />
Wild and more wild they gather'd o'er<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The loud and lost lamenter.</span><br />
<br />
So she whom Magic's wiles had driven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And her own heart persuaded,</span><br />
To tempt a Saint to turn from heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell, snatch'd from life unaided.</span><br />
Yet, not for ever lost, she roves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the winding currents,</span><br />
And utters to the hills and groves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her wail above the torrents.</span><br />
<br />
For yet some bard shall wander by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With harp and song so holy,</span><br />
That they shall wrench the caves where lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her limbs in anguish lowly.</span><br />
And free her for the blessed light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And air again to greet her</span><br />
Awhile, before she takes her flight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To where the Saint shall meet her.</span><br />
<br />
Even I, for little Ermengarde,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would harp a life-long morrow,</span><br />
But to reverse that doom so hard,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lead her back from sorrow;</span><br />
Mid happy thoughts again to beam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All joyousness partaking;</span><br />
But never more of Saints to dream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When summer morns are breaking.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "ERMENGARDE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>I.&mdash;St. Herbert's Isle, placed nearly in the centre of Derwent
Lake, derives its name from a hermit who lived there in
the seventh century, and had his cell on this island.</p>

<p>It contains about four acres of ground, is planted with firs
and other trees, and has a curious octagonal cottage built with
unhewn stones, and artificially mossed over and thatched.
This was erected many years ago by the late Sir Wilfred
Lawson, to whose representative the island at present belongs.
A few yards from its site are the ruins of the hermitage formerly
occupied by the recluse. These vestiges, being of stone
and mortar, give the appearance of its having consisted of two
apartments; an outer one, about twenty feet long and sixteen
feet broad, which has probably been his chapel, and another,
of narrower dimensions, his cell, with a little garden adjoining.</p>

<p>The scene around was well adapted to excite the most
solemn emotions, and was in unison with the severity of his
religious life. His plot of ground and the waters around him
supplied his scanty fare; while the rocks and mountains inspired
his meditations with the most sublime ideas of the might
and majesty of the Creator. It is no wonder that "St. Herbert,
a priest and confessor, to avoid the intercourse of man,
and that nothing might withdraw his attention from unceasing
meditation and prayer, chose this island for his abode."</p>

<p>There is no history of St. Herbert's life and actions to be
met with, or any tradition of his works of piety or miracles,
preserved by the inhabitants of the country. His contemporary
existence with St. Cuthbert, and his equo-temporary death
with him obtained by the prayers of the saint, at the time and
in the manner related below, according to the old legends, is
all that is known of him.</p>

<p>Bede, in his History of the Church of England, writes thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>of the saint:&mdash;"There was a certain priest, revered for his
uprightness and perfect life and manners, named Herberte,
who had a long time been in union with the man of God (St.
Cuthbert of Farn Isle) in the bond of spiritual love and friendship;
for living a solitary life in the isle of that great and
extended lake from whence proceeds the river Derwent, he
used to visit St. Cuthbert every year, to receive from his lips
the doctrines of eternal life. When this holy priest heard of
St. Cuthbert's coming to Luguballea (Carlisle), he came, after
his usual manner, desiring to be comforted more and more
with the hopes of everlasting bliss by his divine exhortations.
As they sat together, and enjoyed the hopes of heaven, among
other things the Bishop said, 'Remember, brother Herberte,
that whatsoever ye have to say and ask of me, you do it now,
for after we depart hence, we shall not meet again, and see
one another corporeally in this world, for I know well the
time of my dissolution is at hand, and the laying aside of this
earthly tabernacle draweth on apace.' When Herberte heard
this, he fell down at his feet, and, with many sighs and tears,
beseeched him, for the love of the Lord, that he would not
forsake him, but to remember his faithful brother and associate,
and make intercession with the gracious God, that they might
depart hence into heaven together, to behold his grace and
glory whom they had in unity of spirit served on earth; for
you know I have ever studied and laboured to live according
to your pious and virtuous instructions; and in whatsoever
I offended through ignorance or frailty, I straightway used
my earnest efforts to amend after your ghostly counsel, will,
and judgment.'&mdash;At this earnest and affectionate request of
Herberte's, the Bishop went to prayer, presently being certified
in spirit that this petition to heaven would be granted&mdash;'Arise,'
said he, 'my dear brother; weep not, but let your rejoicing
be with exceeding gladness, for the great mercy of God hath
granted to us our prayer.'&mdash;The truth of which promise and
prophecy was well proved in that which ensued; for their
separation was the last that befell them on earth; on the same
day, which was the 19th day of March, their souls departed
from their bodies, and were straight in union in the beatific
sight and vision&mdash;and were transported hence to the kingdom
of heaven by the service and hands of angels."</p>

<p>It is probable that the hermit's little oratory, or chapel,
might be kept in repair after his death, as a particular veneration
seems to have been paid by the religious of after ages to
this retreat, and the memory of the Saint.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>There is some variation in the account given by authors of
the day of the Saint's death; Bede says the 19th day of March:
other authors the 20th day of May, A. D., 687; and by a
record given in Bishop Appleby's Register, it would appear
that the 13th day of April was observed as the solemn
anniversary.</p>

<p>But, however, in the year 1374, at the distance of almost
seven centuries, we find this place resorted to in holy services
and procession, and the hermit's memory celebrated in
religious offices. The Vicar of Crosthwaite went to celebrate
mass in his chapel on the island, on the day above mentioned,
to the joint honour of St. Herbert and St. Cuthbert; to every
attendant at which forty days' indulgence was granted as a
reward for his devotion. "What a happy holiday must that
have been for all these vales," says Southey; "and how
joyous on a fine spring day must the lake have appeared, with
the boats and banners from every chapelry; and how must
the chapel have adorned that little isle, giving a human and
religious character to the solitude!"</p>

<p>In the little church of St. John's in the Vale, which is one
of the dependent chapelries of the church of Crosthwaite, is
an old seat, with the date 1001 carved on the back of it, to
which tradition assigns, that it was formerly in St. Herbert's
Chapel, on the island in Derwent Lake.</p>

<p>These figures correspond with those on the bell in the Town
Hall at Keswick, said to have been brought from Lord's
Island.</p>


<p>II.&mdash;Bowscale Tarn is a small mountain lake, lying to the
north-east of Blencathra. It is supposed by the country
people in the neighbourhood, with whom it has long been a
tradition, to contain two immortal fish; the same which held
familiar intercourse with, and long did the bidding of, the
Shepherd Lord when he studied the stars upon these mountains,
and gathered that more mysterious knowledge, which,
matured in the solitude of Barden Tower, has till this day
associated his name with something of supernatural interest in
this district, where he so long resided.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>From some lines of Martial (lib. iv. 30) it appears that there
were some fishes in a lake at Baiæ in Campania consecrated
to Domitian, and like the undying ones of Bowscale Tarn,
they knew their master:&mdash;</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<div class="poem">
"Sacris piscibus hæ natantur undæ,<br />
Qui norunt dominum, manumque lambunt;<br />

</div>


<p>III.&mdash;It has been stated with reference to the river Greta,
that its channel was formerly remarkable for the immense
stones it contained; and that by their concussion in high
floods were caused those loud and mournful noises which not
inappropriately have gained for it the characteristic title of
"Mourner." Mr. Southey has given the following description
of it in his "Colloquies";&mdash;"Our Cumberland river Greta
has a shorter course than even its Yorkshire namesake. St.
John's Beck and the Glenderamakin take this name at their
confluence, close by the bridge three miles east of Keswick on
the Penrith road. The former issues from Leathes Water, in
a beautiful sylvan spot, and proceeds by a not less beautiful
course for some five miles through the vale from which it is
called, to the place of junction. The latter receiving the stream
from Bowscale and Threlkeld Tarns, brings with it the waters
from the south side of Blencathra. The Greta then flows
toward Keswick; receives first the small stream from Nathdale;
next the Glenderaterra, which brings down the western
waters of Blencathra and those from Skiddaw Forest, and
making a wide sweep behind the town, joins the Derwent
under Derwent Hill, about a quarter of a mile from the town,
and perhaps half that distance from the place where that river
flows out of the lake, but when swollen above its banks, it
takes a shorter line, and enters Derwent Water.</p>

<p>"The Yorkshire stream was a favourite resort of Mason's,
and has been celebrated by Sir Walter Scott. Nothing can
be more picturesque, nothing more beautiful, than its course
through the grounds at Rokeby, and its junction with the
Tees;&mdash;and there is a satisfaction in knowing that the possessor
of that beautiful place fully appreciates and feels its beauties,
and is worthy to possess it. Our Greta is of a different
character, and less known; no poet has brought it into notice,
and the greater number of tourists seldom allow themselves
time for seeing anything out of the beaten track. Yet the
scenery upon this river, where it passes under the sunny side
of Latrigg, is of the finest and most rememberable kind:</p>

<div class="poem">
&mdash;Ambiguo lapsu, refluitque fluitque,<br />
Occurrensque sibi venturas aspicit undas.<br />
</div>

<p>There is no English stream to which this truly Ovidian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>description can more accurately be applied. From a jutting
isthmus, round which the tortuous river twists, you look over
its manifold windings, up the water to Blencathra; down it,
over a high and wooded middle ground, to the distant mountains
of Newlands, Cawsey Pike, and Grizedale."</p></blockquote>

A joyful train left Lucy's halls<br />
At morning, cheer'd with bugle calls,<br />
That long ere eve, a mournful train,<br />
Returned to Lucy's halls again.<br />
<br />
They went with hound and spear and bow,<br />
To lay the prowling wild-wolf low.<br />
They came with hound and bow and spear&mdash;<br />
And one fair daughter on her bier.<br />
<br />
Her prancing palfrey starting wide,<br />
She gallop'd from Lord Lucy's side,<br />
A shining huntress, gay, and bold,<br />
And fair as Dian's self of old.<br />
<br />
The quarry cross'd her lover's view;<br />
He led the chace with shrill halloo,<br />
Through brake and furze, by stream and dell,<br />
Nor stopp'd until the quarry fell.<br />

She stood where broad before her lay<br />

By Hole of Haile she turned her steed:<br />

They found her; but their words were "Woe!"<br />
"Woe to the bank where thou liest low!<br />
Woe to the hunting of this day,<br />

With downcast faces, eyeballs dim,<br />
They bore her up that mount&mdash;to him<br />
A Mount of Sorrow evermore,<br />
Too faithful to the name it bore.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "GUNILDA; OR, THE WOEFUL
CHASE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>A traditional story in the neighbourhood of Egremont
relates the circumstance of a lady of the Lucy family being
devoured by a wolf. According to one version this catastrophe
occurred on an evening walk near the Castle; whilst, a more
popular rendering of the legend ascribes it to an occasion on
which the lord of the manor, with his lady and servants, were
hunting in the forest; when the lady having been lost in the
ardour of the chase, was after a long search and heart-rending
suspense, found lying on a bank slain by a wolf which was in
the act of tearing her to pieces. The place is distinguished by
a mound of earth, near the village of Beckermet, on the banks
of the Ehen, about a mile below Egremont. The name of
Woto Bank, or Wodow Bank as the modern mansion erected
near the spot is called, is said to be derived by traditionary
etymology, from the expression to which in the first transports
of his grief the distracted husband gave utterance&mdash;"Woe to
this bank."</p>

<p>Hutchinson is inclined to believe "that this place has been
witness to many bloody conflicts, as appears by the monuments
scattered on all hands in its neighbourhood; and by some the
story is supposed to be no more than an emblematic allusion
to such conflicts during the invasion of the Danes. It is
asserted that no such relation is to be found in the history of
the Lucy family; so that it must be fabulous, or figurative of
some other event."</p>

<p>There are, however, yet to be seen in the burial ground
attached to the Abbey Church of St. Bees, the remaining
parts of two monumental figures which may reasonably be
presumed to have reference to some such event as that recorded
by tradition. The fragments, which are much mutilated, are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>of stone; and the sculpture appears to be of great antiquity.
Common report has assigned to these remains the names of
Lord and Lady Lucy.</p>

<p>In their original state, the figures were of gigantic size.
The features and legs are now destroyed. The Lord is
represented with his sword sheathed. There is a shield on
his arm, which appears to have been quartered, but the
bearings upon it are entirely defaced. On the breast of the
Lady is an unshapely protuberance. This was originally the
roughly sculptured limb of a wolf, which even so lately as the
year 1806, might be distinctly ascertained. These figures
were formerly placed in an horizontal position, at the top of
two raised altar tombs within the church. The tomb of the
Lady was at the foot of her Lord, and a wolf was represented
as standing over it. The protuberance above mentioned, on
the breast of the Lady, the paw of the wolf, is all that now
remains of the animal. About a century since, the figure of the
wolf wanted but one leg, as many of the inhabitants, whose
immediate ancestors remembered it nearly entire, can testify.
The horizontal position of the figures rendered them peculiarly
liable to injuries, from the silent and irresistible ravages of
time. Their present state is, however, principally to be
attributed to the falling in of the outer walls of the priory, and
more particularly to their having been used, many years since,
by the boys of the Free Grammar School, as a mark to fire
at. There can be little doubt that the limb of the wolf has
reference to the story of one of the Ladies Lucy related above.</p>

<p>It may not however be unworthy of remark, that the Lucies
were connected, through the family of Meschines, with Hugh
d' Abrincis, Earl of Chester, who in the year 1070 is said to
have borne azure a wolf's head erased argent, and who had
the surname of Lupus.</p>

<p>The wife of Hugh Lupus was sister to Ranulph de Meschin.</p>

<p>The family of Meschines has been said to be descended from
that at Rome called by the name Mæcenas, from which the
former one is corrupted. "Certainly," says a recent writer,
"it has proved itself the Mæcenas of the Priory of St. Bees,
not merely in the foundation of that religious house, but also
in the charters for a long course of years, which have been
granted by persons of different names, indeed, but descended
from, or connected with, the same beneficent stock." This is
shown in the following extract from a MS. in the Harleian
Collection:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>
<p>"Be y<sup>t</sup> notid that Wyllyam Myschen son of Ranolf Lord
of Egermond founded the monastery of Saint Beysse of blake
monks, and heyres to the said Meschyn y<sup>s</sup> the Lords Fitzwal,
the Lord Haryngton, and the Lord Lucy, and so restyth
founders of the said monastery therle of Sussex the Lord
Marques Dorset, therle of Northumberland as heyres to the
Lords aforesaid."</p>

<p>The religious house thus restored, consisting of a prior and
six Benedictine monks, was made a cell to the mitred Abbey
of Saint Mary, at York. And under this cell, Bishop Tanner
says, there was a small nunnery situated at Rottington, about
a mile from St. Bees.</p>

<p>At the dissolution, the annual revenues of this priory,
according to Dugdale, were £143 17<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>; or, by Speed's
valuation, £149 19<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>; from which it appears there were
only two religious houses in the county more amply endowed,
viz. the priory of Holme-Cultram, and the Priory of St. Mary,
Carlisle; which latter was constituted a cathedral church at
the Reformation.</p>

<p>The conventual church of St. Bees is in the usual form of a
cross, and consists of a nave with aisles, a choir, and transepts,
with a massive tower, at the intersection, which until lately
terminated in an embattled parapet. This part of the building
is now disfigured by an addition to enable it to carry some
more bells. The rest of the edifice is in the early English
style, and has been thoroughly restored with great taste and
feeling. On the south side of the nave there was formerly a
recumbent wooden figure, in mail armour, supposed to have
been the effigy of Anthony, the last Lord Lucy of Egremont,
who died A. D. 1368. The Lady Chapel, which had been a
roofless ruin for two centuries, was fitted up as a lecture-room
for the College established by Bishop Law in 1817.</p>

<p>The priors of this religious house ranked as barons of the
Isle of Man; as the Abbot of the superior house, St. Mary's,
at York, was entitled to a seat amongst the parliamentary
barons of England. As such he was obliged to give his
attendance upon the kings and lords of Man, whensoever they
required it, or at least, upon every new succession in the
government. The neglect of this important privilege would
probably involve the loss of the tithes and lands in that island,
which the devotion of the kings had conferred upon the priory
of St. Bees.</p>

<p>In the library of the Dean and Chapter of Carlisle is the
following curious account of the discovery of a giant at St.
Bees:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>
<p>"A true report of Hugh Hodson, of Thorneway, in Cumberland,
to S<sup>r</sup> Rob Cewell (qy. Sewell) of a Gyant found at
S. Bees, in Cumb'land, 1601, before X<sup>t</sup> mas.</p>

<p>"The said Gyant was buried 4 yards deep in the ground,
w<sup>ch</sup> is now a corn feild.</p>

<p>"He was 4 yards and an half long, and was in complete
armour: his sword and battle-axe lying by him.</p>

<p>"His sword was two spans broad and more than 2 yards
long.</p>

<p>"The head of his battle axe a yard long, and the shaft of it
all of iron, as thick as a man's thigh, and more than 2 yards
long.</p>

<p>"His teeth were 6 inches long, and 2 inches broad; his
forehead was more than 2 spans and a half broad.</p>

<p>"His chine bone could containe 3 pecks of oatmeale.</p>

<p>"His armour, sword, and battle-axe, are at Mr. Sand's of
Redington, (Rottington) and at Mr. Wyber's, at St. Bees."&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE SHIELD OF FLANDRENSIS.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The Knight sat lone in Old Rydal Hall,<br />
Of the line of Flandrensis burly and tall.<br />
His book lay open upon the board:<br />
His elbow rested on his good sword:<br />
His knightly sires and many a dame<br />
Look'd on him from panel and dusky frame.<br />
High over the hearth was their ancient shield,<br />
An argent fret on a blood-red field&mdash;<br />
"Peace, Plenty, Wisdom."&mdash;"Peace?" he said:<br />
"Peace there is none for living or dead."<br />
<br />
The Autumnal day had died away:<br />
The reapers deep in their slumbers lay:<br />
The harvest moon through the blazoned panes<br />
From Scandale Brow poured in the stains:<br />
His household train, and his folk at rest,<br />
And most the child that he loved best:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>His startled ear caught up the swell<br />
Of distant sounds he knew too well.<br />
By his golden lamp to the shield he said,<br />
"Peace? Peace there is none for living or dead."<br />
<br />
The Knight he came of high degree,<br />
None better or braver in arms than he:<br />
Worthy of old Flandrensis' fame,<br />
Whose soul not battle nor broil could tame.<br />
That neighing and trampling of horses late,<br />
That hubbub of voices round his gate,<br />
That sound of hurry along the floors,<br />
That dirge-like wail through distant doors,<br />
Tempestuous in the calm, he heard:<br />
And he looked on the shield, nor spoke, nor stirr'd.<br />
<br />
From inmost chambers far remote<br />
Responsive flow'd one dirge-like note:<br />
Loud through the arches deep and wide<br />
One little voice did sweetly glide;<br />
Its sad accords along the gloom<br />
Swelled on towards that lordly room&mdash;<br />
"We wait not long, our watch we keep,<br />
We all are singing, and none may sleep:<br />
When stone on stone nor roof remain,<br />
The unresting shall have rest again."<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span><br />
The Knight turned listening to the door.<br />
His little maid came up the floor.<br />
Her nightly robe of purest white<br />
Gleamed purer in the faded light.<br />
The blazoned moonbeams slowly swept<br />
The spaces round, as on she stept.<br />
And lo! in his armour from head to toe,<br />
With his beard of a hundred winters' snow,<br />
Stood old Flandrensis burly and tall,<br />
With his breast to the shield, and his back to the wall.<br />
<br />
The six score winters in his eyes<br />
Unfroze, as on through the blazoned dyes,<br />
Sable, and azure, and gules, she came.<br />
Through his heaving beard low fluttered her name.<br />
But slowly and solemnly, leading or led<br />
By phantoms chanting for living or dead,<br />
Pass'd on the little voice so sweet&mdash;<br />
"We all are singing: we all must meet"&mdash;<br />
And into the gloom like a fading ray:<br />
And the form of Flandrensis vanished away.<br />
<br />
The Knight, alone, in his ancient hold,<br />
Sat still as a stone: his blood ran cold.<br />
For his little maiden was his delight.<br />
Then forth he strode in the face of the night.<br />
His dogs were in kennel, his steeds in stall:<br />
His deer were lying about his hall:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>His swans beneath the Lord's Oak Tree:<br />
The silvery Rotha was flowing free.<br />
He set his brow towards Scandale hill:<br />
The vale was breathing, but all was still.<br />
<br />
He thought of the spirits the snow-winds rouse,<br />
The Piping Spirits of Sweden Hows,<br />
That wail to the Rydal Chiefs their fate&mdash;<br />
That pipe as they whirl around lattice and gate,<br />
With their grey gaunt misty forms: but now,<br />
There was not a stir in the lightest bough:<br />
The winds in the mountain gorge were laid;<br />
No sound through all the moonlight stray'd.<br />
He turned again to his ancient Keep:<br />
There all was silence, and calm, and sleep.<br />
<br />
But all grew changed in the gloomy pile.<br />
His little maiden lost her smile.<br />
The menials fled: that knightly race<br />
Was left alone in its ancient place:<br />
The pride of its line of warriors quailed&mdash;<br />
Those sworded knights once peerless hailed:<br />
To the earth broke down from its hold their shield.<br />
With its argent fret and its blood-red field:<br />
And they fled from the might of the powers that strode<br />
In the darkness through their old abode.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span><br />
And Sir Michael brooded an autumn day,<br />
As he looked on the slope at his child at play,<br />
On the green by the sounding water's fall:<br />
And often those words did he recall&mdash;<br />
"We wait not long, our watch we keep;<br />
We all are singing, and none may sleep.<br />
When stone on stone nor roof remain,<br />
The unresting shall have rest again."<br />
And the Knight ordained, as he brooded alone&mdash;<br />
"There shall not be left of it roof or stone."<br />
<br />
And Sir Michael said&mdash;"I will build my hall<br />
On the green by the sounding waterfall:<br />
And an arbour cool at its foot, beside.<br />
And I'll bury my shield in the crystal tide,<br />
To cleanse it from blood perchance, that so<br />
Peace, Plenty, and Wisdom again may flow<br />
Round old Flandrensis' honours and name."<br />
And the pile arose: and the sun's bright flame<br />
Was pleasant around it: and morn and even<br />
It lay in the light and the hues of heaven.<br />
<br />
And Sir Michael sat in the arbour cool,<br />
Where the waters leapt in the crystal pool;<br />
Saying&mdash;"Gone is yon keep to a grim decay.<br />
And now, my little one, loved alway!<br />
Whence came thy singing so wild and deep?"&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>&mdash;"We all were singing, and none might sleep,<br />
Till all the Unmerciful heard their strain.<br />
But now the unresting have rest again."&mdash;<br />
<br />
So the keep went down to the dust and mould.<br />
And the new pile bore the blazon of old&mdash;<br />
The pride of the old ancestral shield&mdash;<br />
The argent fret on the blood-red field;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">"Peace, Plenty, Wisdom"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 5.5em;">Beneath enscrolled.</span><br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE SHIELD OF FLANDRENSIS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The ancient Manor house at Rydal stood in the Low Park,
on the top of a round hill, on the south side of the road leading
from Keswick to Kendal. But on the building of the new
mansion on the north side of the highway, in what is called
the High Park, the manor house became ruinous, and got the
name of the Old Hall, which, says Dr. Burn, in his time, "it
still beareth." Even then there was nothing to be seen but
ruinous buildings, walks, and fish ponds, and other marks of
its ancient consequence; the place where the orchard stood
was then a large enclosure without a fruit tree in it, and called
the Old Orchard. At the present day few indications of its
site remain. Tradition asserts that it was deserted from
superstitious fears.</p>

<p>The present mansion was erected by Sir Michael le Fleming
in the last century. It stands on the north side of the road,
on a slope facing the south, is a large old fashioned building,
and commands a fine view of Windermere. Behind it rises
Rydal Head, and Nab-Scar a craggy mountain 1030 feet above
the level of the sea. The Park is interspersed with abundance
of old oaks, and several rocky protuberances in the lawn are
covered with fine elms and other forest trees. The Lord's
Oak, a magnificent specimen, is built into the wall on the
lower side of the Rydal Road over which it majestically
towers. "The sylvan, or rather forest scenery of Rydal
Park," says Professor Wilson, "was, in the memory of living
men, magnificent, and it still contains a treasure of old trees."</p>

<p>The two waterfalls, the cascades of the rivulet which runs
through the lawn, are situated in the grounds. The way leads
through the park meadow and outer gardens by a path of
singular beauty and richness. They are in the opinion of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>Gilpin and other tourists unparalleled in their kind. The
upper fall is the finest, in the eyes of those who prefer the
natural accessories of a cascade: but the lower one, which is
below the Hall, is beheld from the window of an old summer
house. This affords a fine picture frame; the basin of rock
and the bridge above, with the shadowy pool, and the overhanging
verdure, constituting a perfect picture.</p>

<p>The heraldic distinction, the fret, is found more than once
in Furness Abbey, and is undoubtedly the ancient arms of le
Fleming. An entire seal appended to a deed from Sir
Richard le Fleming of Furness dated 44 Edward the Third
(1371) shews a fret hung cornerwise, the crest, on a helmet a
fern, or something like it. The seal annexed to another deed
dated 6 Henry V. (1419) is the same as above described; the
motto, <i>S. Thome Flemin</i>, in Saxon characters.</p>

<p>The present crest and motto are of modern date, and
explain each other: the serpent is the emblem of wisdom, as
the olive and the vine are of peace and plenty. But upon
what occasion this distinction was taken does not appear.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE ROOKS OF FURNESS.</h2>

<div class="poem">
"Caw! Caw!" the rooks of Furness cry.<br />
"Caw! Caw!" the Furness rooks reply.<br />
In and about the saintly pile,<br />
Over refectory, porch, and aisle,<br />
Perching on archway, window, and tower,<br />
Hopping and cawing hour by hour.<br />
Saint Mary of Furness knows them well!<br />
They are souls of her Monks laid under a spell.<br />
They were once White Monks; ere the altars fell,<br />
And the vigils ceased, and the Abbey bell<br />
Was hush'd in the Deadly Nightshade Dell.<br />
<br />
"Caw! Caw!" for ever, from morn<br />
Till night they trouble the ruins forlorn:<br />
Roger the Abbot, parading in black,<br />
Briand the Prior, and scores at his back<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>Of those old fathers cawing amain,<br />
All robed in rooks' black feathers, in vain<br />
Waiting again for the Abbey to rise,<br />
For matins to waken the morning skies,<br />
And themselves to chant the litanies.<br />
<br />
"Caw! Caw!" No wonder they caw!<br />
To see&mdash;where their vigorous rule was law&mdash;<br />
Fair Love with his troops of youths and maids,<br />
With holiday hearts, through greenwood shades<br />
Come forth, and in every Muse's name,<br />
With songs, a joyful time proclaim;<br />
And to hear the car-borne Demon's yell,<br />
The Steam-Ghoul screeching the fatal knell<br />
Of peace in the Deadly Nightshade Dell.<br />
<br />
"Caw! Caw!" still over the walls<br />
You wheel and flutter, with ceaseless calls;<br />
Thinking, no doubt, of your cells and holes,<br />
You poor old Monks' translated souls!<br />
Sad change for you to be cawing here,<br />
And black, for many a hundred year!<br />
But haunt as you may your ancient pile,<br />
You will never more chant in the holy aisle;<br />
You never will kneel as you knelt of yore;<br />
Nor the censer swing, nor the anthem pour;<br />
And your souls shall never shake off the spell<br />
That binds you to all you loved so well,<br />
Ere the altars fell, and the Abbey bell<br />
Was hush'd in the Deadly Nightshade Dell.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span><br />
"Caw! Caw!" In the ages gone,<br />
When the mountains with oak were overgrown,<br />
Up the glen the Norskmen came,<br />
Lines of warriors, chiefs of fame&mdash;<br />
With Bekan the Sorcerer, earthward borne,<br />
By toil, and battle, and tempest worn&mdash;<br />
Crowding along the dell forlorn.<br />
Over the rill, high on the steep,<br />
There in his barrow wide and deep,<br />
With axe and hoe those armed men<br />
Buried him down, by the narrow glen,<br />
With the flower, at his feet, of wondrous spell:<br />
Buried him down, and covered him well,<br />
And left him hid by the lonely Dell.<br />
<br />
"Caw! Caw!" O would the wise Monks had known<br />
Who slept his sleep in that barrow alone,<br />
When they gathered the bekan he made to grow,<br />
And bore it to bloom in the dell below.<br />
For they pulled at the heart of the mighty Dead;<br />
And they broke his peace in his narrow bed;<br />
And on fibre and root the Sorcerer's power<br />
Fasten'd the spell that changed the flower;<br />
From sweet to bitter its juices pass'd;<br />
And the deadly fruit on the poisoned blast<br />
Scattered its sorcery ages down.<br />
And where once with cowl and gown,<br />
Hymning the Imperial Queen of Light,<br />
Went forth the Monks&mdash;the shade of night<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>Was spread more deadly than tongue can tell.<br />
Witchery walked where all had been well:<br />
Well with all that hymned and prayed;<br />
Well with Monk, and well with maid<br />
That sought the Abbey for solace and aid.<br />
But the lethal juices wrought their spell:<br />
One by one was rung their knell:<br />
One by one from choir and cell<br />
They floated up with a hoarse farewell;<br />
And the altars fell, and the Abbey bell<br />
Was hush'd in the Deadly Nightshade Dell.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE ROOKS OF FURNESS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>In the southern extremity of Furness, about half a mile to
the west of Dalton, a deep narrow vale stretches itself from
the north, and opens to the south with an agreeable aspect to
the noonday sun; it is well watered with a rivulet of fine
water collected from the adjacent springs, and has many convenient
places for mills and fish-ponds. This romantic spot
is the Vale of Deadly Nightshade, or, as it is sometimes
called, Bekangs-Gill.</p>

<p>The solitary and private situation of this dell being so well
formed and commodious for religious retreat had attracted
the attention of Evanus, or Ewanus, a monk, originally
belonging to the monastery of Savigny in Normandy, from
which he and a few associates had migrated, and had
recently seated themselves at Tulket, near Preston in
Amounderness, where Evanus was chosen to be their first
abbot. Accordingly, they were induced to change their
residence; and exactly three years and three days after
their settling at Tulket on the fourth of the nones
of July, 1124, they removed to the sequestered shades of
Bekangs-Gill, and there began the foundation of the magnificent
Abbey of St. Mary in Furness, in magnitude only second
of those in England belonging to the Cistercian Monks, and
the next in opulence after Fountains Abbey in Yorkshire,
being endowed with princely wealth and almost princely
authority, and not unworthy of the style in which its charter
records the gifts and grants, with all their privileges, of its
Royal founder, "to God and St. Mary," in the following
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In the name of the Blessed Trinity, and in honour of St.
Mary of Furness, I Stephen, earl of Bulloign and Mortaign,
consulting God, and providing for the safety of my own soul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>the soul of my wife the countess Matilda, the soul of my lord
and uncle Henry king of England and duke of Normandy,
and for the souls of all the faithful, living as well as dead, in
the year of our Lord 1127 of the Roman indiction, and the
5th and 18th of the epact:</p>

<p>"Considering every day the uncertainty of life, that the
roses and flowers of kings, emperors, and dukes, and the
crowns and palms of all the great, wither and decay; and
that all things, with an uninterrupted course, tend to dissolution
and death:</p>

<p>"I therefore return, give and grant, to God and St. Mary
of Furness, all Furness and Walney, with the privilege of
hunting; with Dalton, and all my lordship in Furness, with
the men and everything thereto belonging, that is, in woods
and in open grounds, in land and in water; and Ulverston,

and every thing within Furness, except the lands
of Michael Le Fleming; with this view, and upon this condition,
That in Furness an order of regular monks be by
divine permission established: which gift and offering I by
supreme authority appoint to be for ever observed: and that
it may remain firm and inviolate for ever, I subscribe this
charter with my hand; and confirm it with the sign of the
Holy Cross.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The magnitude of the Abbey may be known from the
dimensions of the ruins; and enough is standing to show
the style of the architecture, which breathes the same simplicity
of taste which is found in most houses belonging to
the Cistercian monks, which were erected about the same
time with Furness Abbey. The round and pointed arches
occur in the doors and windows. The fine clustered Gothic
and the heavy plain Saxon pillars stand contrasted. The
walls shew excellent masonry, are in many places counter-arched,
and the ruins discover a strong cement. But all is
plain: had the monks even intended, the stone would not
admit of such work as has been executed at Fountains and
Rieval Abbeys. The stone of which the buildings have been
composed is of a pale red colour, dug from the neighbouring
rocks, now changed by time and weather to a tint of dusky
brown, which accords well with the hues of plants and
shrubs that everywhere emboss the mouldering arches.</p>

<p>The church and cloisters were encompassed with a wall,
which commenced at the east side of the great northern door,
and formed the strait enclosure; and a space of ground, to
the amount of sixty-five acres, was surrounded with a strong
stone wall, which enclosed the porter's lodge, the mills,
granaries, ovens, kilns, and fish-ponds belonging to the Abbey,
the ruins of which are still visible. This last was the great
enclosure, now called the deer-park, within which, placed on
the crown of an eminence that rises immediately from the
Abbey, and seen over all low Furness, are the remains of a
beacon or watch-tower, raised by the society for their further
security, and commanding a magnificent prospect. The door
leading to it is still remaining in the enclosure wall, on the
eastern side.</p>

<p>During the residence of the monks at Tulket, and until the
election of their fifth Abbot (Richard de Bajocis) they were of
the order of Savigny under the rule of St. Benedict; and from
their habit or dress were called Grey Monks; but at the time
of the general matriculation of the Savignian monasteries with
that of Citeaux, the monks of Furness also accepted of the
reform, exchanged their patron St. Benedict for St. Bernard,
changed their dress from grey to white, and so became White
Monks, Bernardins, or Cistercians, the rule of which order they
religiously observed until the dissolution of the monasteries.</p>

<p>The Cistercian order in its origin was devoted to the practice
of penance, silence, assiduous contemplation, and the angelical
functions (as Mr. West expresses it) of singing the divine
praises; wherefore it did not admit of the ordinary dissipation
which attends scholastic enquiries. St. Bernard who was
himself a man of learning, well knowing how far reading was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>necessary to improve the mind even of a recluse, took great
care to furnish his monks with good libraries. Such of them
as were best qualified were employed in taking copies of
books in every branch of literature, many of which, beautifully
written on vellum, and elegantly illuminated, are at this
time to be seen in their libraries. They used neither furs nor
linen, and never eat any flesh, except in time of dangerous
sickness; they abstained even from eggs, butter, milk, and
cheese, unless upon extraordinary occasions, and when given
to them in alms. They had belonging to them certain religious
lay brethren, whose office was to cultivate their lands, and
attend to their secular affairs: these lived at their granges and
farms, and were treated in like manner with the monks, but
were never indulged with the use of wine. The monks who
attended the choir slept in their habits upon straw; they rose
at midnight, and spent the rest of the night in singing the
divine office. After prime and the first mass, having accused
themselves of their faults in public chapter, the rest of the day
was spent in a variety of spiritual exercises with uninterrupted
silence. From the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross
(the 14th of September) until Easter they observed a strict
fast: and flesh was banished from their infirmaries from Septuagesima
until Easter. This latter class of monks was confined
to the boundary wall, except that on some particular
days the members of it were allowed to walk in parties
beyond it, for exercise and amusement; but they were very
seldom permitted either to receive or pay visits. Much of
these rigorous observances was mitigated by a bull of Pope
Sixtus IV., in the year 1485, when among other indulgencies
the whole order was allowed to eat flesh three times in every
week; for which purpose a particular dining-room, separate
and distinct from the usual refectory, was fitted up in every
monastery. They were distinguished for extensive charities
and liberal hospitality; for travellers were so sumptuously
entertained at the Abbey, that it was not till the dissolution
that an inn was thought necessary in this part of Furness,
when one was opened for their accommodation, expressly
because the Monastery could no longer receive them. With
the rules of St. Bernard the monks had adopted the white
cassock, with a white caul and scapulary. Their choral dress
was either white or grey, with caul and scapulary of the same,
and a girdle of black wool; over that a hood and a rocket,
the front part of which descended to the girdle, where it
ended in a round, and the back part reached down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>middle of the leg behind: when they appeared abroad, they
wore a caul and full black hood.</p>

<p>The privileges and immunities granted to the Cistercian
order in general were very numerous: and those to the Abbey
of Furness were proportioned to its vast endowments. The
Abbot held his secular court in the neighbouring castle of
Dalton, where he presided, with the power of administering
not only justice, but injustice, since the lives and property
of the villain tenants of the lordship of Furness were
consigned by a grant of King Stephen to the disposal
of the lordly Abbot! The monks also could be arraigned,
for whatever crime, only by him. The military establishment
of Furness likewise depended upon the Abbot.
Every mesne lord and free homager, as well as the customary
tenants, took an oath of fealty to the Abbot, to be true to
him against all men, except the king. Every mesne lord
obeyed the summons of the Abbot, or his steward, in raising
his quota of armed men; and every tenant of a whole tenement
furnished a man and a horse of war for guarding the
coast, for the border service, or any expedition against the
common enemy of the king and kingdom. The habiliments
of war were a steel coat, or coat of mail, a falce, or falchion,
a jack, the bow, the byll, the crossbow, and spear.</p>

<p>What wonder, says a lively writer, that Abbot Pele, or any
other man, owning such vast possessions and having such temporal
and spiritual privileges as the following, should have
grown proud and gross, and contumacious! Within the
limits of his own district he was little short of omnipotent.
The same oath of fealty was taken to him as to the king
himself; he had no less than twelve hundred and fifty-eight
able men armed with coats of mail, spears, and bows and
arrows, upon the possessions of the Monastery, ready for
active service, four hundred of whom were cavalry; besides
manorial rights, he had extended feudal privileges, appointment
of sheriff, coroner, and constable, wreck of the sea,
freedom from suit of county; a free market and fair at Dalton,
with a court of criminal jurisdiction; lands and tenements
exempt from all toll and tax whatever; the emoluments incidental
to wardship, such as the fining of young ladies who
married against his will, &amp;c. He had the patronage of all the
churches save one; no bailiff could come into his territories
under any pretence whatever; and no man was to presume
in any way to molest or disturb him on pain of forfeiting ten
pounds to the king. In addition to its rich home territory in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>the North Lonsdale, the Abbey possessed the manor of Beaumont
in the south; land and houses at Bolton, and in many
other places near Lancaster; five villages in Yorkshire, with
much land and pasturage; and a mansion for the abbot, in
York itself; all beautiful Borrowdale in Cumberland was
their property; houses at Boston in Lincolnshire; land in the
Isle of Man; and houses in Drogheda and two other towns
in Ireland. The home lordship comprehended the rich district
of Low Furness and all the district included between the
river Duddon on the one side, and the Elter (beginning at the
Shire Stones on the top of Wrynose), Lake Windermere and
the Leven on the other; with the isles of Walney and Foulney,
and the Pile of Fouldrey. They had an excellent harbour of
refuge fitted to accommodate the largest vessels of that era at
any time of tide, and they had four good iron mines in their
near neighbourhood, the ore of which, however, they do not
seem to have exported. The total income of the society
appears, at the time of its dissolution in 1537, to have been
more than nine hundred pounds a-year; which would be
represented by about ten times that value in our time, or <i>nine
thousand a-year</i>.</p>

<p>But in the reign of Edward the First, its revenues seem to
have been nearly as large again. According to the late Mr.
Beck, the author of <i>Annales Furnesienses</i>, to which we are
indebted for much of these particulars, the tenants of the
Abbey paid great part of their rents by provisioning the
monks with grain, lambs, calves, &amp;c., or bartered them for
beer, bread, iron, wood, and manure. More than two
hundred gallons of beer were distributed weekly among these
tenants upon tunning days, accompanied with about three
score of loaves of bread; the expenditure in this particular
alone, per annum, must have been at least one thousand
pounds of our present money: one ton of malleable iron was
also given to the same people for the repair of their ploughs,
and wood for that of their houses and fences. They might
take, too, all the manure&mdash;amounting yearly to four or five
hundred cartloads&mdash;with the exception of that from the
Abbot's and high stables. The tenants paid by way of fine,
or admission to their tenements, but one penny, called "God's
Penny," and were sworn to be true to the king and to the
convent. What alms were distributed amongst the poor by
this wealthy and pious society we have no means of discovering.
It was bound, upon the anniversary of Saints
Crispin and Crispinian, to distribute two oxen, two cows, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>one bull among the poor folks who assembled for that purpose
at the Porter's Lodge. At the same place, ninety-nine
shillings' worth of bread, and six maze of <i>fresh</i> herrings,
valued at forty shillings, were also given in alms every Monday
and Tuesday; the convent maintained from its very commencement
thirteen poor men, allowing each of them thirty-three
shillings and fourpence yearly: and eight widows
received a similar allowance of provisions to that allowed for
the same number of monks. They had five flagons of ale
weekly, and each of them a <i>clibanus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> which it is supposed
must have been a certain quantity of bread. Lastly, there
were two schools held in some part of the monastery, where
the children of those tenants who paid their rent in provisions,
and who it is probable lived in the neighbourhood, received
their education gratuitously, and dined in the hall during their
attendance as well. If one of these showed symptoms of
superior intelligence, he had the privilege of being elected
into the society in preference to all others, by which step he
might rise by good fortune or <i>finesse</i> even to be Lord of
Furness.</p>

<p>The society numbered three and thirty monks at the time
of its dissolution, and about one hundred converts and
servants, and no convert was admitted who could not pay for
the labour of an hireling. To have been head of such a
colony at home, and to have wielded such a power abroad,
must have made even the most pious of abbots "draw too
proud a breath;" and yet with all the faults and all the vices
of that cowled priesthood, we cannot now forbear to pity their
sad fate, when bidden by the remorseless king to leave their
grand old residences and quiet ways of life wherein they had
lived so long!</p>

<p>It must be added, that to so much power and so great
prosperity, with all the beneficence and usefulness of the
society there had come to be allied an amount of profligacy
and irreligion proportionate to the many advantages which it
had enjoyed.</p>

<p>The early part of the sixteenth century found the morality
of the monastery represented in many instances by social
arrangements in direct violation of the injunctions laid upon
all monastic institutions, "in the king's behalf;" amongst
others, of that one which especially enjoins that "women of
what state or degree soever they be, be utterly excluded from
entering into the limit or circuit of this monastery or place,
unless they first obtain license of the King's Highness, or his
visitor." It was stated, and apparently well authenticated,
that Rogerus Pele (abbot) had two wives, or what amounted
to the same thing, two concubines; and amongst his subordinate
monks, Johannes Groyn had one, whilst Thomas Hornsby
had five. Thus, evil days in one sense had already come;
and others were fast drawing nigh. The mandate, moreover,
had been prepared for their destruction independently of
these and such like shortcomings; but they afforded a
powerful handle by which to wrest them to destruction.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>First came the commissioners appointed by the King for
visiting the monasteries in the North of England, with their
searching examination into everything connected with each
separate society: next, the list of crimes charged on the
monks at the time of the visitation: then the devices of the
Earl of Sussex "advertised" in his letter to the King, wherein
"I, the said erle, devising with myselfe, yf one way would
not serve, how, and by what other means, the said monks
might be ryd from the said abbey;" the summons to Whalley
of the unhappy Abbot to make his proposal, in his own
handwriting, according to the "ded enrolled, which A. Fitzherbert
hath drawn" for the surrender of his monastery to the
King: and then the final consummation of all. For come it
must. On the 7th day of April, 1537, in spite of prayers to
the "kynge," in spite of many a "shillinge in golde" given
to the "right honerable and our singler goode Mr. Mayster
Thomas Cromwell, secretarie to the Kynge's highness," the
royal commissioners came down upon their prey. After
hanging the Abbot of Whalley, and the royal injunction that
"all monks and chanons, that be in any wise faultie, are <i>to be
tyed uppe without further delay or ceremonie</i>," the Abbot of
Furnesse is found "to be of a very facile and ready minde,"
and all hope of averting his doom being over, and his sense
of peril hastening his submission, "it coming freely of himself
and without enforcement," he signed the fatal deed of surrender,
confessing with contrition "the mysorder and evil lyfe
both to God and our prynce of the brethren of this monasterie;"
the pen passed from the hand of the Superior to each
monk in succession, and the "lamp on the altar of St. Mary
of Furness was extinguished for ever."</p>

<p>With forty shillings given to them by the King, and clad in
"secular wedes" (that is, lay garments), without which they
were not permitted to depart, they turned their faces from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>their magnificent home in the Nightshade Dell. To the
degraded Abbot was given the Rectory of Dalton, valued at
£33 6s. 9d. yearly, obtained with difficulty, and even of
which he was not allowed undisturbed possession. But no
traces of his associates at the Abbey appear to have survived
their departure from it, unless we dimly discern them in the
miserable record which relates that sixteen years after the
period of their dissolution, fifteen pounds<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> were still paid in
annuities out of the revenues of the late monastery; that
noble possession which the hapless Thirty surrendered to the
King.</p>

<p>Of the three and thirty monks of which the society at
Furness was composed, the names of the Abbot, the Prior,
and twenty-eight of the brethren, were appended to the deed:
two had been committed to ward and sure custody in the
King's castle of Lancaster, for being "found faultye:"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and
one of the number remains unaccounted for.</p></blockquote>

<h2>KING DUNMAIL.</h2>

<div class="poem">
They buried on the mountain's side<br />
King Dunmail, where he fought and died.<br />
But mount, and mere, and moor again<br />
Shall see King Dunmail come to reign.<br />
<br />
Mantled and mailed repose his bones<br />
Twelve cubits deep beneath the stones;<br />
But many a fathom deeper down<br />
In Grisedale Mere lies Dunmail's crown.<br />

Climb thou the rugged pass, and see<br />
High midst those mighty mountains three,<br />
How in their joint embrace they hold<br />
The Mere that hides his crown of gold.<br />
<br />
There in that lone and lofty dell<br />
Keeps silent watch the sentinel.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "KING DUNMAIL."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The heroic king Dunmail was the last of a succession of
native princes, who up to the tenth century ruled over those
mountainous provinces in the north-western region of England
which were chiefly peopled by the earliest masters of Britain,
the Celtic tribes of Cymri, or Picts. The territories of
Dunmail, as king of Cumbria, included the entire tract of
country from the western limits of the Lothians in Scotland
to the borders of Lancashire, and from Northumberland to
the Irish Sea.</p>

<p>The several British kingdoms which were originally comprised
within this area maintained a long and resolute
resistance against the power of the first Saxon monarchs;
and although in the course of time most of them were brought
under the supremacy of those strangers, as tributary provinces,
they still continued a sort of independent existence, electing
their own kings and obeying their own laws.</p>

<p>On the establishment of the Heptarchy, several of these
provinces were included within the Saxon kingdom of Northumbria;
but although they were claimed by the Northumbrian
monarchs, there was even then little admixture of their people
with the fair-haired followers of Hengist and Horsa, and each
continued to be governed by its own chieftain or king until
the Norman conquest, and existed under what was called the
Danish law. So long as the native chieftains were allowed to
exercise a subordinate authority, the Northumbrian kings had
no occasion to interfere with the internal government of the
subject provinces. If the tribute was duly rendered, they
remained unmolested; if it was withheld, payment was
enforced by arms; or, in extreme cases, the refractory state
(to use a modern phrase) was "annexed," and the domestic
government extinguished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the petty rulers of these British kingdoms no notices
have been transmitted to us. These are confined to the kings
of Strathclyde, or, as they are designated by our earliest
informers, of Alclyde; the latter being the name of their
capital, which stood on a rocky eminence, adjacent to the
modern town of Dumbarton; whilst the former significantly
describes the position of their territory in the great strath or
valley of the Clyde. This little district (of Strathclyde),
which must not be confounded with the larger territory of
Cumbria, that as yet had no existence under any general
government or common name, comprised the modern counties
of Lanark, Ayr, and Renfrew, on the south of the Clyde,
and, probably, Dumbartonshire on the north. In the series
of Strathclydian kings, tradition has placed the name of the
celebrated King Arthur; and the local nomenclature is said
to afford many traces of his fame, especially in the case of their
citadel of Alclyde, or Dumbarton, which is styled "Castrum
Arthuri," in a record of the reign of David the Second.
Ryderic, the successor of Arthur, died in 601, in the eighth
year of the reign of Ethelfrith, king of Northumberland; and
from that time onward, during the remainder of this and the
succeeding reigns of Edwin and Oswald, we hear nothing
of the independent existence of this people, nor do we even
know the names of their chieftains; it is probable that they
had been reduced to subjection. But in the very year of
Oswald's disastrous death, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 642, we find the Britons
carrying on important military operations on their own
account, in which Owen their king distinguished himself, by
slaying on the battle-field of Strath-carmaic, Donal Break,
king of the Scots. During the long reign of Oswi in Northumberland,
we read of one king of Strathclyde, Guinet, but
the record is only of his death, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 657, not of any exploit
which he performed. On the death of Ecgfrith, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 670,
the Britons of Strathclyde appear to have recovered their
liberty; and thenceforward we have a tolerably complete list
of their kings during the two succeeding centuries.</p>

<p>Ethelfrith, who had effected the conquest of the central
and western portion of Northumbria, and may be regarded as
the founder of the Northumbrian kingdom, "conquered," as
we read in Beda, "more territories from the Britons than
any other king or tribune;" but although he was thus able
to overrun a vast district of country, his followers were not
sufficiently numerous to colonise it. In some places, indeed,
"he expelled the inhabitants, and placed Angles in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>stead," but "in others," and doubtless to a much greater
extent, "he allowed the vanquished to retain their lands, on
payment of tribute." In the reign of Edwine, too, the Anglo-Saxon
population were under his immediate government; the
petty British States were still ruled by tributary princes.
And no doubt their political condition continued more or less
the same during the century and half which preceded the
dissolution of the Heptarchy, and after the reconstruction of
its several parts under one crown.</p>

<p>On Northumbria being overrun by the renowned Danish
Viking Healfdene, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 875, fifty years after the Heptarchal
kingdoms had been dissolved, it is recorded that the indigenous
inhabitants of the part called Cymriland, the Cumbrians,
or Britons, being too weak to defend themselves from the
hateful aggressions of the Danes, and deprived of the protection
of the Saxon kings of Northumbria, who had themselves
succumbed to the common enemy, turned for aid to the only
neighbours who seemed sufficiently powerful to resist the
invaders. They therefore implored the aid of Grig or Gregory,
king of Scotland, by whose assistance in the following year
the Scandinavian ravagers were expelled. These Indigen&oelig;, or
British inhabitants, must have been the people of Galloway,
and of the district around Carlisle; for the Strathclyde
Britons were already under the authority of Gregory, as the
guardian of Eocha, a minor, who, as the son of Hu king of
Strathclyde, and nephew of the second Constantine, king of
Scotland, succeeded to the crowns of both these realms.
Whether the Britons subsequently quarrelled with their
powerful ally, and being defeated in battle, were obliged to
cede to the victor their rocky highlands and adjacent places;
or they voluntarily submitted themselves to Gregory, with
their lands and possessions, thinking it preferable to be subject
to the Scots, who, although enemies, were Christians, than
to infidel pagans, there does not appear to be any evidence to
determine.</p>

<p>The vigour of Gregory king of Scotland having been found,
notwithstanding his prowess and the success of his arms,
inadequate to support an authority which had been usurped
by him as regent during the minority of Eocha, after holding
the reins of government in Scotland and Strathclyde during
eleven years, was expelled, together with Eocha, by Donal,
son of the late King Constantine II., <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 893.</p>

<p>To Donal, who was slain by the Danes, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 904, succeeded
his cousin Constantine III., the son of Aodh, who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>slain by Gregory. Another Donal, brother to Constantine
III., had been "elected" king of the Strathclyde Britons
four years before the elevation of that monarch to the throne
of Scotland. During the life of this Donal, the districts of
Carlisle and Galloway were not united to Strathclyde, but
remained attached to Scotland; from which, however, they
were separated after his decease, and given to his son and
successor, Eugenius.</p>

<p>To the new kingdom, thus founded by Constantine in favour
of his nephew and presumptive heir, by the union of Carlisle
and Galloway with Strathclyde, was given the name of Cumbria,
derived from the common appellation of its inhabitants. Its
extent is precisely defined in a return made by the prior and
convent of Carlisle to a writ of Edward the First, requiring
them, as well as other religious houses, to furnish, from
chronicles or other documents in their possession, any information
bearing upon the alleged right of supremacy over
Scotland vested in the English crown. The return sets forth,
"That district was called Cumbria, which is now included in
the bishoprics of Carlisle, Glasgow, and Whitherne, together
with the country lying between Carlisle and the river
Duddon:" in other words, the entire tract from the Clyde to
the confines of Lancashire. In the "Inquisitio Davidis,"
which does indeed extend to all parts of Cumbria which
remained in David's possession, we are expressly told that
"he had not then within his dominion the whole Cumbrian
region," the present county of Cumberland, or, as it was then
called, Earldom of Carlisle, having been severed from it soon
after the Norman Conquest. Although Fordun is the only
author who narrates the cession of Carlisle and Galloway to
Gregory, and the subsequent grant of these districts to
Eugenius, whereby they were united to Strathclyde, and the
whole merged into a single government, we have abundant
evidence of the existence of Cumbria and the intimate union
of Constantine and Eugenius at this period. In the year 938,
these princes, in conjunction with the Danes and Welsh,
attempted to wrest the sovereign power out of the vigorous
hands of Athelstane. The combined forces were signally
defeated by the Anglo-Saxon monarch at Brunanburgh (supposed
by some to be Bromborough, near Chester); Eugenius
was slain, and Constantine escaped only by a precipitate
retreat.</p>

<p>It is at this period that Dunmail, the second and last <i>sole</i>
"king of rocky Cumberland," appears upon the historic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>stage. It has been thought not improbable that he was the
son of Eugenius or Owen, the preceding king, and the same
person who is described as Dunwallon, "the son of Owen,"
and who died at Rome thirty years after his memorable
engagement with Edmund of England and Leoline of South
Wales, in the mountain pass which is distinguished by his
name. "In the annals of Ulster, indeed," say the supporters
of this supposition, "this Dunwallon is described as king of
Wales, but Caradoc calls him prince of Strathclyde, and his
patronymic designation seems to identify him with Dunmail,
if, as we assume, the latter was the son of the first king of
Cumberland." But by whatever means Dunmail obtained
the crown; whether by inheritance as the son of Eugenius,
or by "election" as one of the native Cumbrian princes, and
according to the ancient custom of the Britons; we soon find
him supporting the Northumbrians in hostilities against the
Saxon monarch, Edmund the First. That monarch, although
victorious, was so weakened that he dared not pursue Dunmail
without the assistance of the Scots. And the condition upon
which Malcolm, king of Scotland, joined Edmund with his
forces, was, that if they were successful, Malcolm should
possess Cumbria by paying homage to Edmund and his
successors. The subjection of this wild race of mountaineers
was then determined upon as a necessary step towards the
pacification of the kingdom; and the last record which history
affords us of the Cumbrian Britons, is that of their defeat,
<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 945, in the heart of their native mountains, between
Grasmere and Keswick, and their final dispersion or emigration
into Wales.</p>

<p>The place where Dunmail determined to hazard the battle
which proved fatal to him was the famous Pass which bears
his name. Edmund slew his vanquished enemy upon the spot
which is still commemorated by the rude pile of stones so well
known as his cairn; and, in conformity with the barbarous
customs of that age, put out the eyes of his two sons; after
which, having completely ravaged and laid waste the territories
of Dunmail, he bestowed them on his ally Malcolm; the latter
undertaking to preserve in peace the Northern parts of
England, and to pay the required fealty and homage to
Edmund. Upon the same conditions they were afterwards
confirmed to him by one of Edmund's successors, Edgar;
which monarch also divided what at that time remained of
the ancient kingdom of Northumbria into Baronies, and
constituted it an Earldom. Thenceforward these north
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>western regions were held as a military benefice subject to the
English sceptre by the heir to the crown of Scotland, under
the title of the Principality of Cymriland or Cumbria. This
Principality, which included Westmorland, continued in
possession of the heirs to the Scottish crown during the reigns
of Harold and Hardicanute, the last Danish Kings, and of
Edward the Confessor and Harold the Second, the last Saxon
monarchs of England.</p>

<p>The only circumstance which is recorded of it during the
century which followed the defeat of Dunmail, is its total
devastation by Ethelred, king of England, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1000, at
which time it is represented by Henry of Huntingdon as the
principal rendezvous of the marauding Danes.</p>

<p>In the year 1052, Macbeth held the Scottish throne, whilst
Malcolm, the son of his predecessor, the murdered Duncan,
sat on that of Cumbria. Siward, earl of Northumberland,
was commissioned by Edward the Confessor to invade Scotland,
and avenge the "murder" of Duncan. In this he
succeeded, defeated and slew Macbeth, and placed the king
of Cumbria, or, as some historians assert, his son, on the
throne of Scotland. This Malcolm, surnamed Canmore,
held at the time of the Conquest, Cumbria and Lothian, in
addition to the ancient kingdom of Scotland.</p>

<p>In the year 1072, the Earldom of Carlisle, containing the
present County of Cumberland, with the Barony of Westmorland,
was wrested from Malcolm Canmore by William
the Conqueror, who granted it to his powerful noble, Ranulph
de Meschin, one of that numerous train of military adventurers,
amongst whom he had distributed all the fair territory of
Britain, to hold, with a sort of royal power, by the sword, as
he himself held the kingdom by virtue of the crown,&mdash;<i>tenere
ita libere ad gladium, sicut ipse rex tenebat Angliam per
coronam</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the existing limits were established between England
and Scotland. The kingdom of Cumbria was reduced to the
dimensions indicated by the "Inquisitio Davidis," and was
held as a principality dependent on the crown of Scotland;
until it at length became formally attached to the Scottish
dominions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Barony of Westmorland having been
separated from the Earldom of Carlisle, there remained the
district comprised within the present limits of the County of
Cumberland, to which alone that name was thenceforward
applied.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<p>The circular heap of stones which forms the pile called
Dunmail-Raise, and gives its name to the mountain Pass
between the vales of Grasmere and Wytheburn, is seen
adjoining the highroad, where it is crossed by the wall which
there marks the boundaries of Westmorland and Cumberland.
The stones constituting this rude monument are thrown loosely
together on each side of an earthen mound in a huge cairn
or <i>raise</i>, the history of which is little known, and concerning
which antiquarians are by no means agreed. It measures
twenty-four yards in diameter, and rises gradually to an
elevation of six feet, being flat at the top, and the centre
indicated by a well defined space in rather larger stones.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilpin conjectures that the pile was probably intended to
mark a division not between the two Counties of Cumberland
and Westmorland, but rather between the two kingdoms of
England and Scotland, in elder times, when the Scottish
border extended beyond its present bounds. The generally
received tradition, however, concerning this cairn is, that it was
raised to commemorate the name and defeat of Dunmail, the last
king of Cumbria, in the year 945, in his conflict with the
Saxon Edmund, on the occasion above related. "But,"
says Mr. Gilpin, "for whatever purpose this rude pile was
fabricated, it hath yet suffered little change in its dimensions;
and is one of those monuments of antiquity, which may be
characterized by the scriptural phrase of <i>remaining to this very
day</i>."</p>

<p>The legend of the Cumbrian hero and his host, awaiting
the completion of their rocky pile beneath the lonely mountain
pass; from which they are to issue in their appointed time to
join "in that great battle which will be fought before the end
of the world;" is but one of the beliefs which seem to have
been left behind them by our Scandinavian ancestors. It is
in fact another version of the story of Woden and his host,
whose winter trance is enacted by various popular heroes;
and which has not only been localised amongst ourselves,
but has almost overspread all christendom. The original
nature of Woden or Odin was represented as that of a
storm god, who swept through the air in roaring winds,
either alone or with a great retinue consisting of souls of
the dead which have become winds. The whirlwind,
which precedes the tempest, and has ravaged the woods and
fields, is pursued to its death in the last storms of autumn.
Sometimes the god is pictured as a hunter, and the winds
have taken the shapes of men, dogs, etc., whilst the whirlwind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>figures as a boar. The achievement of its death is soon
followed by that of the hunter Woden himself; who during
the winter is dead, or asleep, or enchanted in the cloud
mountain. From this beautiful fiction of a twilight age, the
winter trance of Woden, has grown up the story of those
caverned warriors, which, under whatever name they are
known, and wherever they repose, are all representations of
Odin and his host.</p>

<p>Arthur, the vanished king, our own Arthur, whose return
is expected by the Britons, according to mediæval Germany,
is said to dwell with his men at arms in a mountain; all well
provided with food, drink, horses, and clothes.</p>

<p>Charlemagne slumbers with his enchanted army in many
places; in the Desenberg near Warburg, in the Castle of
Herstella on the Weser, in the Karlsburg on the Spessart,
the Frausberg and the Donnersberg on the Pfalz, etc.</p>

<p>The Emperor Henry the Fowler is entranced in the Sudernerberg,
near Goslar.</p>

<p>The Emperor Frederick Barbarossa is in a cavern in the
Kyffhaüser mountain, in the old palatinate of the Saxon
imperial house. There with all his knights around him, he
sits to this day, leaning his head upon his arm, at a table
through which his beard has grown, or round which, according
to other accounts, it has grown twice. When it has thrice
encircled the table he will wake up to battle. The cavern
glitters with gold and jewels, and is as bright as the sunniest
day. Thousands of horses stand at mangers filled with thorn
bushes instead of hay, and make a prodigious noise as they
stamp on the ground and rattle their chains. The old Kaiser
sometimes wakes up for a moment and speaks to his visitors.
He once asked a herdsman who had found his way into the
Kyffhaüser, "Are the ravens (Odin's birds) still flying about
the mountain?" The man replied that they were. "Then,"
said Barbarossa, "I must sleep a hundred years longer."</p>

<p>The Eildon Hills, which witnessed of old the magical
exploits of Michael Scott, are three in number. These were
originally one: their present formation being the work of a
demon, for whom the wizard, in fulfilment of some infernal
contract, was obliged to find employment, and by whom the
mighty task was achieved in a single night. They are nearly
of the same height, changing greatly their appearance, and,
as it were, their attitude, with the point of view; at one time
one of them only being visible, at another time two, and
again all three. They form a peculiar and romantic feature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>in the scenery of the Tweed: and are still to the eye of
the imagination what they once were in the common belief,&mdash;wizard
hills, the subjects of wild traditions and unearthly
adventures. In them lay for centuries those "caverned
warriors," which Thomas the Rhymer showed at night to the
daring horse jockey, who went by appointment to the Lucken
Hare to receive the price of the black horse which he had
sold to the venerable favourite of the Fairy Queen. His
money having been paid to him, in ancient coin; on the
invitation of his customer to view his residence, he followed
his guide in the deepest astonishment through long ranges of
stalls, in each of which a horse stood motionless, while an
armed warrior lay equally still at the charger's feet. "All
these men," said the prophet in a whisper, "will awaken at
the battle of Sheriffmuir."</p>

<p>The small mountain lake, called Grisedale Tarn, is situated
at a very considerable elevation above the surrounding vales,
in a depression formed at a point where the shoulders of
Helvellyn, Seat-Sandal, and Fairfield touch each other; and
just below the summit of the "hause" or pass through which
winds the mountain track that leads from Grasmere into
Patterdale.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE BRIDALS OF DACRE.</h2>

<div class="poem">
The Baron of Greystoke is laid in the quire.<br />
Who is she that sits lone in her mourning attire?<br />
Her maids all in silence stand weeping apart:<br />
Or but whisper the woe that is big at her heart.<br />
<br />
From her guardian the King the dread summons has come;<br />

<br />
But what is to her all their homage and state,<br />
Since the youthful Lord Dacre may pass not their gate?<br />

And the Cliffords to-morrow will bear her to Brough'm.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span><br />
"With him, O with him," in her sorrow she cried,<br />
"With the gallant Lord Dacre to run by my side<br />
"In the fields, as of old, with his hand on my rein,<br />
"I would give all the wealth the wide world can contain."&mdash;<br />
<br />
Lord Dacre forget her? No! sooner the might<br />
Of Helvellyn shall bend to the storm on its height;<br />
He has vow'd&mdash;"Let them woo! but in spite of the King<br />

As the Cliffords rode hard on that morrow to claim<br />
The fair ward of the King, by Lord Dacre's they came.<br />
And they cast out their words in derision and scorn,<br />
As they pass'd by his tower in the prime of the morn.<br />
<br />
"Shall we greet the bright heiress of Greystock for thee?<br />
"Or await thee at Brough'm her rich bridal to see?"<br />
&mdash;"In our annals," he cried, "we've a story of old,<br />
"A fit tale for a bridal, that <i>twice</i> shall be told.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span><br />
"In your Skipton's high hall, in your stateliest room<br />
"Of Pendragon, and high through the arches of Brough'm,<br />
"Have your bridals been sung, but not one to the lay<br />
"That I'll ring through old Brough'm for the bride on that day.<br />
<br />
"Your meats may be scant, and unbrimm'd the bright bowl;<br />
"But the notes of that tale through your fortress shall roll!<br />
"Here I pledge me, proud Cliffords! come friend, or come foe,<br />
"With that tale of old times to her bridal I'll go!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
Loud laugh'd they in scorn as hard onward they rode:<br />
And the horsemen and horses all gallantly show'd.<br />
With bright silver and gold, too, her harness did ring,<br />
As they rode back to Brough'm with the Ward of the King.<br />
<br />
And proud was the welcome, and courtly the grace,<br />
And warm was the clasp of that stately embrace,<br />
When the Lady of Brough'm took her home to her breast,<br />
Like a lamb to the fold, a lone dove to its nest.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span><br />
But in still hours of night, and mid pastimes by day,<br />
To the wild woods of Greystoke her heart fled away,<br />
To the fields where, as once with <i>his</i> hand on her rein,<br />
She would give all the world to ride child-like again.<br />
<br />
It was night; when the moon through her circle had worn;<br />
And back into darkness her crescent was borne;<br />
Not in fancy nor dreams came a voice to her side&mdash;<br />
"Sweet, awake thee, Lord Dacre is come for his bride."<br />
<br />
Through the lattice he bore her, and fast did he fold<br />
In his arms the sweet prize from the wind and the cold;<br />
Sprang the wall to his steed, and o'er moorland and plain<br />
Bore her off to his Tower by the Dacor again.<br />
<br />
And the Cliffords that morn in their banquetting hall<br />
Read the legend his dagger had traced on the wall&mdash;<br />
"In the annals of Dacre the story is told<br />
Of Matilda the Fair and Lord Ranulph the Bold!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span><br />
"The bride-meats unbaked, and the bride-cup unbrew'd,<br />
Not by bridesmaid for bride even a rose to be strew'd,<br />
Was the way with our sire in that story of old<br />
Of Matilda the Fair and Lord Ranulph the Bold!<br />
<br />
"But they woke up to fury in Warwick that morn.<br />
For a bride from their Fortress by night had been borne.<br />
And your annals in Brough'm of its sluggards shall ring,<br />
That have lost for the Cliffords the Ward of their King."<br />
<br />
The beard of that Baron curled fiercely with ire,<br />
And the blood through his veins raged&mdash;a torrent of fire,<br />
As he glanced from the panel by turns to his sword;<br />
And then strode from the hall without deigning a word.<br />
<br />
They sought her through turret, by bush, and by stone;<br />
But the bower had been broken, the Beauty was gone;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>And the joy-bells of Dacre from Greystock to Brough'm<br />
Pealed the news through the vales that the bride was brought home.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE BRIDALS OF DACRE."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Dacre Castle, one of the outermost of a chain of border
fortresses stretching down the valleys of the Eamont and the
Eden in Cumberland, is a plain quadrangular building, with
battlemented parapets, and four square turrets, one at each
corner; it is now converted into a farm house. The moat is
filled up, although the site is still to be traced, and the
outworks are destroyed. There are two entrances&mdash;one at
the west tower, and another between the towers in the east
front. The walls are about seven feet in thickness. There
are two arched dungeons communicating by steps with the
ground floor; and access was obtained to the roof by means
of four circular staircases, one in each tower; some of which
are now closed up. The staircases, however, did not conduct
to the top of the towers; this was gained by means of stone
steps from the roof of the Castle.</p>

<p>Bede mentions a monastery, which being built near the
river Dacor, took its name from it, over which the religious
man Suidbert presided. It was probably destroyed by the
Danes, and never restored; and there are no vestiges of it
remaining: the present church is supposed to have been built
from the ruins.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury speaks of a Congress held at Dacre
in the year 934, when Constantine, king of Scotland, and his
nephew Eugenius, king of Cumberland, met king Athelstan,
and did homage to him at Dacre. This fact is singularly
corroborated by there being in the Castle a room called to
this day the "room of the three kings," while the historical
fact itself is entirely forgotten in the country. This proves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>the antiquity of the tradition, which has survived the original
building and attached itself to the present, no part of which
dates from an earlier period than the fourteenth century.
That Dacre was in those remote times a place of some
importance is evident from the meeting aforesaid. The occasion
appears to have been the defection of Guthred, with
Anlaff his brother, and Inguld king of York, when Athelstan
levied a great force, and entered Northumberland so unexpectedly,
that the malcontents had scarcely time to secure
themselves by flight. Guthred obtained protection under
Constantine, king of Scotland, to whom Athelstan sent
messengers, demanding his surrender, or upon refusal, he
threatened to come in quest of him at the head of his army.
Constantine, although greatly piqued at this message, yet
afraid of the formidable arms of Athelstan, consented to
meet him at Dacre; to which place he came, attended by
the then king of Cumberland, where they did homage to
Athelstan.</p>

<p>After the Conquest, if not before, Dacre was a mesne
manor held of the barons of Greystoke by military suit and
service. The parish, manor, rivulet, and castle, were all
blended with the name of the owners. Their arms, the
pilgrim's scallop, may possibly have been taken from their
being engaged in Palestine; but as the name of their place
dates as far back as the time of Athelstan, the Dacres no
doubt took their name, like most of the families of the
district, from the place where they were settled, and with all
deference to the cross-legged knight<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in the church, who may
or may not have battled at the siege of Acre, its present
Norman spelling is more likely to have arisen from the
manner in which it is entered in the Domesday Book than
from any exploits of his before that famous fortress. That
they were men of high spirit and enterprise, and favourites of
the ladies, there exists convincing evidence. Matilda, the
great heiress of Gilsland,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> was by Randolph Dacre carried
off from Warwick Castle, in the night-time, while she was
Edward the Third's Ward, and under the custody and care of
Thomas de Beauchamp, a stout Earl of Warwick; and
Thomas Lord Dacre dashingly followed the example of his
ancestor, nearly two centuries afterwards, by carrying off,
also in the night time, from Brougham Castle, Elizabeth of
Greystoke, the heiress of his superior lord, who was also the
King's ward, and in custody of Henry Lord Clifford, who,
says Mr. Howard, probably intended to marry her. Their
vigour and ability displayed as wardens of the Marches must
also add favourably to our estimate of them as men.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Sandford in his MS. gives the following curious account,
written apparently immediately after the repair of the Castle
by the Earl of Sussex:&mdash;"And from Matterdale mountains
comes Daker Bek; almost at the foot thereof stands Dacker
Castle alone, and no more house about it, And I protest looks
very sorrowfull, for the loss of its founders, in that huge
battle of Touton feild: and that totall eclips of that great
Lord Dacres, in that Grand Rebellion with lords Northumberland,
and Westmorland in Queen Elizabeth's time, and
in the north called <i>Dacre's Raide</i>.</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash;but it seems an heroyick Chivaleir, steeles the
heir of Lord Moulton of Kirkoswald and Naward and
Gilsland, forth of Warwick Castle, the 5th year of King
Edward the 3rd; and in the 9th year of the same king had
his pdon for marying her and Created Lord Dacres and
Moulton. In King Henry the eight's time the yong Lord
Dacres steels the female heir of the Lord Graistoke forth of
Broham Castle besides Peareth: where the Lord Clifford had
gott her of the king for his sons mariage: and thereupon was
the statute made of felony to marry an heir. And thus
became the Lord Dacres decorate with all the hono<sup>rs</sup> and
Lands of the Lord Graistok a very great Baron: but the now
Earle of Sussex Ancesto<sup>re</sup> had married the female heir of the
Lord Dacres in King Edward the 4th time, before the Lands
of Graistock came to the Lord Dacre's house."</p>

<p>The Barony of Greystoke, which comprehends all that part
of Cumberland, on the south side of the Forest of Inglewood,
between the seignory of Penrith and the manor of Castlerigg
near Keswick, and contains an area comprehending the
parishes of Greystoke, Dacre, and part of Crosthwaite, and
nearly twenty manors, was given by Ranulph de Meschines,
Earl of Cumberland, to one Lyulph, whose posterity assumed
the name of the place, and possessed it until the reign of
Henry the Seventh, when their heiress conveyed it in marriage
to Thomas Lord Dacre, of Gilsland, whose family
ended in two daughters, who married the two sons of the Duke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>of Norfolk. Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, the Duke's
eldest son, had, with his wife, Lady Anne Dacre, the lands
of Greystoke, which have since continued in his illustrious
family.</p>

<p>The original fortress of Greystock was built in the reign of
Edward III. by Lord William de Greystock, that nobleman
having obtained the king's license to castellate his manor-house
of Greystock in the year 1353. Being garrisoned for
Charles I., it was destroyed by a detachment of the Parliamentary
army in June, 1648, except one tower and part of
another. The Castle was almost entirely rebuilt about the
middle of last century by the Hon. Charles Howard, and
additional extensions were subsequently made by his great-grandson,
the eleventh Duke of Norfolk, who bequeathed it
to the present Mr. Howard, by whom the work of renovation
was continued and completed in 1846. In the night of the 3rd
and 4th of May, 1868, it was very seriously damaged by fire.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Greystoke, Baroness Greystoke and Wemme, was
a minor at the time of her father's death. She was the only
daughter of Sir Robert Greystoke, knight, who died June
17th, 1483, in the lifetime of his father, Ralph, seventeenth
Baron Greystoke. By an inquisition held after the death of
that nobleman, it was found that he died on Friday next after
the Feast of Pentecost, in the second year of King Henry
VII., namely, June 1st, 1487. He was succeeded by
Elizabeth, his grand-daughter and heiress, who during her
minority was a ward of the crown, and had special livery of
all her lands in 1506. This lady married Thomas, ninth
Baron Dacre of Gillesland, and third Lord Dacre of the
North; by which marriage the Barony of Greystoke became
united with that of Gillesland.</p>

<p>The nobleman in whose custody the King had placed his
ward was Henry the tenth Baron Clifford, better known as
Lord Clifford the Shepherd. He had married a cousin of
Henry VII., and on the accession of that monarch had been
restored, by the reversal of his father's attainder, to his
honours and estates. Their sons had been educated together,
and brought up in habits of intimacy; and the friendship
thus formed in youth was continued after the one had
succeeded to the crown as Henry VIII., and the other had
ceased to be " Wild Henry Clifford," and had been advanced
by his royal kinsman and associate to the dignity of Earl of
Cumberland.</p>

<p>Of the Lady Elizabeth it is stated that "lord Clifford gott
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>her of the king for his son's marriage;" or for himself, "who
probably intended to marry her." These suppositions lose
something of their importance when we learn that a considerable
disparity in years existed between Lord Clifford and
the Lady, as well as between her and his son; the former
being nearly thirty years her senior, and the latter almost a
dozen years her junior; and during a great portion of her
minority, the first Lady Clifford, though probably residing
much apart from her husband, or unhappily with him, was
yet alive. He was, however, a nobleman nearly allied to the
king, of great power and influence in the north of England,
and had been neighbour to the old Lord Greystoke, her
grandfather. Under the circumstances, the selection made by
the sovereign was a natural one. Her youth, her rank, and
her rich inheritance, were a prize worthy of the aspiration of
the noblest among her peers, whoever may have been the
suitor intended for her by the king; and they were won by
one who afterwards showed that he was as gallant in war as
he had proved himself to be daring and loyal in love.</p>

<p>Lord Dacre, after imitating the spirited bearing of his
ancestor in his love affair, exhibited it in an equal degree in a
more serious enterprise, when it was attended with equal
success. He had a principal command in the English army
in the battle of Flodden Field, which was gained on the 9th
of September, 1514, over the Scots, who had invaded the
kingdom during the absence of Henry VIII. at Tournay.
He commanded the right wing of the army; and wheeling
about during the action, he fell upon the rear of the enemy
and put them to the sword without resistance, and thus contributed
greatly to the complete victory which followed.</p>

<p>The gratitude of his sovereign for his faithful services
invested him with the dignity of the most noble Order of the
Garter, and with the office of Lord Warden of the West
Marches. He died October 24th, 1525, and was buried with
his wife, under the rich altar-tomb, in the south aisle of the
choir of Lanercost.</p>

<p>Brougham Castle in the thirteenth century, the time of John
de Veteripont, the most ancient owner that history points out,
is called in instruments wherein his name is mentioned, the
<i>house of Brougham</i>; from which it is inferred that license had
not then been procured to embattle it. It came to the
Cliffords by the marriage of his grand-daughter Isabella, the
last of the Veteriponts, with Roger, son and heir of Roger
Clifford, of Clifford Castle, Herts, whom the king had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>appointed guardian to her during her minority.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This Roger
de Clifford built the greater part of the Castle, and had placed
over its inner gateway the inscription&mdash;<span class="smcap">This made Roger</span>;
"which," says Bishop Nicholson, "some would have to be
understood not so much of <i>his</i> raising the Castle, as of the
Castle raising <i>him</i>, in allusion to his advancement of fortune
by his marriage, this Castle being part of his wife's inheritance."
On the death of Roger, who was slain in the Isle of
Anglesey, in a skirmish with the Welsh, his widow, during
her son's minority, sat as sheriffess in the county of Westmorland,
upon the bench with the judges there, "concerning the
legality of which," says the Countess of Pembroke, "I
obtained Lord Hailes his opinion."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Her grandson Robert built the eastern parts of the Castle.
During the subsequent centuries it fell several times into
decay, having been destroyed by the Scots and by fire, and
was as often restored.</p>

<p>King James was magnificently entertained at Brougham
Castle, on the sixth, seventh, and eighth days of August,
1617, on his return from his last journey out of Scotland.
After this visit it appears to have been again injured by fire,
and to have lain ruinous until 1651 and 1652, when it was
repaired for the last time, by Anne, Countess of Pembroke,
who tells us, "After I had been there myself to direct the
building of it, did I cause my old decayed Castle of Brougham
to be repaired, and also the tower called the <i>Roman Tower</i>,
in the said old castle, and the court house, for keeping my
courts in, with some dozen or fourteen rooms to be built in it
upon the old foundation." The <i>tower of leagues</i> and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
<i>Pagan tower</i> are mentioned in her Memoirs; and also a state
room called <i>Greystocke Chamber</i>. But the room in which her
father was born, her "blessed mother" died, and King James
lodged in 1617, she never fails to mention, as being that in
which she lay, in all her visits to this place. After the death
of the Countess, the Castle appears to have been neglected,
and has gradually gone to decay.</p></blockquote>

regarded as attached to the estate of Brougham Castle, or the other lands
which had originally belonged to the Veteriponts; it descended with
those estates to the Earls of Thanet: but in 1850 a sheriff was appointed

<h3>NOTES TO "THRELKELD TARN; OR TRUTH
FROM THE DEEPS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Threlkeld or Scales Tarn is a small lake lying deeply
secluded in a recess on the north eastern side of Saddleback,
or Blencathra, between that mountain and Scales Fell. From
the peculiarity of its situation it has excited considerable
curiosity: but the supposed difficulty of access to it, its
insignificant size, and the peculiar nature of its attractions,
cause it to be seldom visited except by those who take it on
their way to the top of Linethwaite Fell, the most elevated
point of the Saddleback range.</p>

<p>Having gained, by a toilsome and rugged ascent from the
south-east, the margin of the cavity in which the Tarn is
imbedded, let the traveller be supposed to stand directly facing
the middle of the mountain, the form of which gives its name
to Saddleback. From the high land between its two most
elevated points before him, and jutting right out to the north-east,
depends an enormous perpendicular rock called Tarn
Crag; at the base of which, engulphed in an immense basin
or cavity of steeps, above and on the left lofty and precipitous,
and gradually diminishing as they curve on the right, lies
Threlkeld Tarn, described as a beautiful piece of circular
transparent water, covering a space of from thirty to thirty-five
acres, and surrounded with a well defined shore. From
the summit, elevated upwards of two hundred yards above it,
its surface is black, though smooth as a mirror; and it lies so
deeply imbedded, that it is said, the reflection of the stars may
be seen therein at noonday. It is generally sunless; and
when illuminated, it is in the morning, and chiefly through an
aperture to the east, formed by the running waters in the
direction of Penrith. "A wild spot it is," says Southey, "as
ever was chosen by a cheerful party where to rest, and take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>their merry repast upon a summer's day. The green mountain,
the dark pool, the crag under which it lies, and the little
stream which steals from it, are the only objects; the gentle
voice of that stream the only sound, unless a kite be wheeling
above, or a sheep bleats on the fell side. A silent solitary
place; and such solitude heightens social enjoyment, as much
as it conduces to lonely meditation."</p>

<p>Southey adds, in a note&mdash;"Absurd accounts have been
published both of the place itself, and the difficulty of reaching
it. The Tarn has been said to be so deep that the reflection
of the stars may be seen in it at noonday&mdash;and that the sun
never shines upon it. One of these assertions is as fabulous
as the other&mdash;and the Tarn, like all Tarns, is shallow."</p>

<p>Its claim to this singularity need not be wholly rejected,
however, on the ground of shallowness, if, to be deeply
imbedded, rather than to be deep, be the essential condition.
Several of the most credible inhabitants thereabouts have
affirmed that they frequently see stars in it at mid-day; but it
is also stated that in order to discover that phenomenon,
there must be a concurrence of several circumstances, viz:
the firmament must be perfectly clear, the air and the water
unagitated; and the spectator must be placed at a certain
height above the lake, and as much below the summit of the
partially surrounding ridge.</p>

<p>The impression produced upon travellers a century ago by
the features of Blencathra at a considerable elevation, will
excite a smile in tourists of the present day. The <i>Southern</i>
face of the mountain is "furrowed with hideous chasms."
One of these "though by far the least formidable," is described
as "unconceivably horrid:" "its width is about two hundred
yards, and its depth at least six hundred." Between two of
these horrible abysses, and separated from the body of the
mountain on all sides by deep ravines, a portion of the hill
somewhat pyramidal in shape stands out like an enormous
buttress. "I stood upon this," says the narrator, whose
account is quoted, "and had on each side a gulf about two
hundred yards wide, and at least eight hundred deep; their
sides were rocky, bare, and rough, scarcely the appearance of
vegetation upon them: and their bottoms were covered
with pointed broken rocks." Again he "arrived where the
mountain has every appearance of being split; and at the
'bottom' he 'saw hills about forty yards high and a mile in
length, which seem to have been raised from the rubbish that
had fallen from the mountain.'" From the summit he "could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>not help observing that the back of this mountain is as remarkably
smooth, as the front is horrid."</p>

<p>Over this front of Blencathra, the bold and rugged brow
which it presents when seen from the road to Matterdale, or
from the Vale of St. John's, the view of the country to the
south and east is most beautiful. The northern side is, as has
been said, remarkably smooth, and in striking contrast to that
so ruggedly and grandly broken down towards the south,
where every thing around bears evident marks of some great
and terrible convulsion of nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Green with his companion, Mr. Otley, was among the
early adventurers who stood on the highest ridge of Blencathra.
This accurate observer, whose descriptions of this, and other
unfrequented and unalterable places, will never be old,
describes without exaggeration the difficulties of the ground
about the upper part of this mountain. Describing the
neighbourhood of the Tarn, he says, "From Linthwaite Pike
on soft green turf, we descended steeply, first southward, and
then in an easterly direction to the tarn,&mdash;a beautiful circular
piece of transparent water, with a well defined shore. Here
we found ourselves engulphed in a basin of steeps, having
Tarn Crag on the north, the rocks falling from Sharp Edge
on the east, and on the west, the soft turf on which we made
our downward progress. These side grounds, in pleasant
grassy banks, verge to the stream issuing from the lake,
whence there is a charming opening to the town of Penrith;
and Cross Fell seen in the extreme distance. Wishing to
vary our line in returning to the place we had left, we crossed
the stream, and commenced a steep ascent at the foot of Sharp
Edge. We had not gone far before we were aware that our
journey would be attended with perils; the passage gradually
grew narrower, and the declivity on each hand awfully
precipitous. From walking erect, we were reduced to the
necessity either of bestriding the ridge or of moving on one of
its sides, with our hands lying over the top, as a security
against tumbling into the tarn on the left, or into a frightful
gully on the right, both of immense depth. Sometimes we
thought it prudent to return; but that seemed unmanly, and
we proceeded; thinking with Shakespeare, that "dangers
retreat when boldly they're confronted." Mr. Otley was the
leader, who, on gaining steady footing, looked back on the
writer, whom he perceived viewing at leisure from his saddle
the remainder of his upward course."</p></blockquote>

<h2>ROBIN THE DEVIL'S COURTESY.</h2>

<div class="poem">
While the vales of the North keep the Philipsons' fame,<br />
Calgarth and Holm-Isle will exult at their name!<br />
Ever true to the rights of the King, and his throne,&mdash;<br />
Now hearken how Robin was true to his own!<br />
<br />
"Ride, brother! ride stoutly, ride in from Carlisle!<br />
For the Roundheads from Kendal beleaguer Holm-Isle.<br />
On land and on mere I have fifty at bay;<br />
And I speed on mine arrow this message away!"&mdash;<br />
<br />
The arrow struck truly the henchman's far door;<br />
And swift from the arrow that message he tore.<br />
Then, booted and spurr'd, over mountain and plain<br />
He rides as for life, and he rides not in vain.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span><br />
He has reached the fair City, has sought through the crowd<br />
The bold form of his master, and thus spoke aloud&mdash;<br />
"The Roundheads beleaguer my lord in his Isle,<br />
And he bids thee for life to ride in from Carlisle."&mdash;<br />
<br />
He rode with his men, and he came to the Mere,<br />
When a shout for the Philipsons burst on his ear;<br />
And his errand sped well; for the Whigs to a man,<br />
At the sight of his horsemen, all mounted and ran.<br />
<br />
"Now listen, my Brother!&mdash;I stay'd by the Isle,<br />
Whilst thou for the King wert array'd at Carlisle;<br />
I have stood by thy treasure; I've guarded thy store;<br />
I have kept our good name; and now this I'll do more!<br />
<br />
"Yon braggart, that thief-like came on in the dark,<br />
And thought to catch Robin&mdash;but miss'd his good mark!<br />
I'll repay him his visit; and, by the great King!<br />
I'll be straight with the varlet, and make his casque ring."&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span><br />
With a half-score of horsemen, next Sunday at morn,<br />
While the sound of the bells o'er the meadows was borne,<br />
To the Kent he rode easily&mdash;on to the town&mdash;<br />
And along the dull street&mdash;with clenched hand and dark frown.<br />
<br />
"Is there none of this Boaster's fanatical crew<br />
In all Kendal to give me the welcome that's due?<br />
Not a blade of old Noll's, or in street or in porch?<br />
By the Rood, then I'll look for such grace in the church!"<br />
<br />
He spurr'd his wild horse through the open church door;<br />
He spurr'd to the chancel, and scann'd it well o'er;<br />
Then turned by the Altar, and glanced at each one<br />
Of the Roundheads that leapt from their knees, and look'd on.<br />
<br />
But their Leader, the trooper, his foe at the Mere,<br />
His eye could not 'light on&mdash;"He cannot be here!"<br />
So he rushed at the portal; but not ere arose<br />
From the panic-loosed swordsmen harsh words and hard blows.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span><br />
He dashed at the doorway, unstooping; a stroke<br />
From the arch rent his helmet, his saddle-girths broke;<br />
Half-stunn'd from the ground he strove up to his steed,<br />
And ungirth'd has he mounted, and off with good speed.<br />
<br />
With his men at his back, that stood keeping true ward<br />
By each gate, when he entered alone the churchyard,<br />
Soon left he the rebel rout straggling behind;<br />
And was off to his Mere like a hawk on the wind.<br />
<br />
And there with his half-score of horsemen once more<br />
He cross'd to his calm little Isle, from the shore;<br />
And then said bold Robin&mdash;"I've miss'd him, tis true;<br />
But I paid back his visit&mdash;so much was his due!<br />
<br />
"Had I caught but a glance of the low canting knave,<br />
The next psalm that they sung had been over his grave!"&mdash;<br />
And they guess'd through all Westmorland whose was the hand<br />
That would dare such a deed with so feeble a band.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span><br />
Saying&mdash;"Robin the Devil, who man never fear'd,<br />
Would have dared to take Satan himself by the beard;<br />
Then why not a troublesome Whig at his prayers!<br />
&mdash;He'll not try to catch Robin again unawares."<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "ROBIN THE DEVIL'S COURTESY."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Holm Isle, Belle Isle, or Curwen's Island, as it is sometimes
called from the name of its present proprietor, formerly
belonged to the Philipsons of Calgarth, an ancient family in
Westmorland. It is the largest island in Windermere, lying
obliquely across the lake, just above its narrowest part called
the Straits, and opposite to Bowness. It is of an oblong
shape, distant on one side from the shore about half a mile,
on the other considerably less, while at its northern and
southern points there is a large sheet of water extending four
or five miles. It is about one mile and three-quarters in
circumference, and contains nearly thirty acres of land. Its
shores are irregular, occasionally retiring into bays, or breaking
into creeks. A circular structure surmounted by a dome-shaped
roof was erected upon it in 1776, which is so planned
as to command a prospect of the whole lake. The plantations,
consisting of Weymouth pines, ash and other trees, are
disposed so as to afford a complete shelter to the house,
without intercepting the view. The grounds are tastefully
laid out; and the island is surrounded by a gravel walk,
which strangers are permitted to use. In the middle are a few
clumps of trees; and a neat boat-house has been erected
contiguous to the place of landing.</p>

<p>When the ground underneath the site of the house was
excavated, traces of an ancient building were discovered at a
considerable depth below the surface; among which were a
great number of old bricks, and a chimney-piece in its perfect
state. Several pieces of old armour, weapons, and cannon
balls were also found embedded in the soil. In levelling the
ground on the north part of the building, a beautiful pavement
formed of a small kind of pebbles, and several curious
gravel walks were cut through. These were probably some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>remains of "the strong house on the island," in which
Huddleston Philipson is said to have left the family treasure
under the care of his brother "Robin," while he was absent
in the Royal cause at the siege of Carlisle.</p>

<p>During the civil wars these two members of the Philipson
family served the king. Huddleston, the elder, who was the
proprietor of this island, commanded a regiment. Robert
held a commission as major in the same service. He was a
man of great spirit and enterprise; and for his many feats of
personal valour, had obtained among the Oliverians of those
parts the appellation of <i>Robin the Devil</i>.</p>

<p>After the war had subsided, and the more direful effects of
public opposition had ceased, revenge and private malice
long kept alive the animosities of individuals. Colonel Briggs,
a distant kinsman of the Philipsons, of whom, notwithstanding,
he was a bitter enemy, and a steady friend to the usurpation,
resided at this time at Kendal; and under the double character
of a leading magistrate and an active commander, held the
county in awe. This person having heard that Major
Philipson was at his brother's house, on the island in Windermere,
resolved, if possible, to seize and punish a man who
had made himself so particularly obnoxious. With this view
he mustered a party which he thought sufficient, and went
himself on the enterprise. How it was conducted the
narrator does not inform us&mdash;whether he got together the
navigation of the lake, and blockaded the place by sea, or
whether he landed, and carried on his approach in form. It
is probable, as he was reduced to severe privation, that Briggs
had seized all the boats upon the lake, and stopped the
supplies. Neither do we learn the strength of the garrison
within, nor of the works without, though every gentleman's
house was at that time in some degree a fortress. All we
learn is, that Major Philipson endured a siege of eight or ten
days with great gallantry; till his brother the Colonel,
hearing of his distress, raised a party, and relieved him; or,
as another account says, till his brother returned from Carlisle,
after the siege of that city was raised.</p>

<p>It was now the Major's turn to make reprisals. He put
himself therefore at the head of a little troop of horse, and
rode to Kendal. Here being informed that Colonel Briggs
was at prayers (for it was on a Sunday morning), he stationed
his men properly in the avenues, and himself, armed, rode
directly into the church. It is said he intended to seize the
Colonel and carry him off; but as this seems to have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>totally impracticable, it is rather probable that his intention
was to kill him on the spot; and in the midst of the confusion,
to escape. Whatever his intention was, it was frustrated, for
Briggs happened to be elsewhere.</p>

<p>The congregation, as might be expected, was thrown into
great confusion on seeing an armed man, on horseback, make
his appearance amongst them; and the Major, taking
advantage of their astonishment, turned his horse round, and
walked quietly out. But having given an alarm, he was
presently assaulted as he left the assembly; and, being seized,
his girths were cut, and he was unhorsed.</p>

<p>Another account says, that having dashed forward down
the principal aisle of the church, and having discovered that
his principal object could not be effected, he was making his
escape by another aisle, when his head came violently in
contact with the arch of the doorway, which was much lower
than that through which he had entered; that his helmet was
struck off by the blow, his saddle girth gave way, and he
himself, much stunned, was thrown to the ground.</p>

<p>At this instant his party made a furious attack on the
assailants, who taking advantage of his mishap, attempted to
detain him; and the Major killed with his own hand the man
who had seized him, clapped the saddle, ungirthed as it was,
upon the horse, and vaulting into it, rode full speed through
the streets of Kendal, calling his men to follow him, and
with his whole party made a safe retreat to his asylum on the
lake, which he reached about two o'clock.</p>

<p>The action marked the man. Many knew him; and they
who did not, knew as well from the exploit, that it could be
nobody but <i>Robin the Devil</i>.</p>

<p>In the Bellingham Chapel, in Kendal Church, is suspended
high over an ancient altar tomb, a battered helmet, through
whose crust of whitewash the rust of ages is plainly to be
discerned. Whether this antique casque belonged to Sir
Roger Bellingham, who was interred <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1557 in the tomb
beneath, and was exalted as a token of the distinction he had
received, when made a knight banneret by the hand of his
sovereign on the field of battle, or was won by the puissant
burgesses of Kendal from one of the Philipsons, and elevated
to its present position as a trophy of their valour, it is,
strangely enough, called the "Rebel's Cap," and forms the
theme of the bold and sacreligious action recorded of Robert
Philipson.</p>

<p>As for "Robin" (who has also, though unjustly, been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>calumniated and accused of having murdered the persons to
whom the skulls at Calgarth belonged, and who figures, it is
said, in many other desperate adventures), after the final
defeat at Worcester had, by depressing for a time the hopes of
the royalists, in some degree restored a sort of subdued quiet
to the kingdom, finding a pacific life irksome to his restless
spirit, he passed over into the sister country, and there fell in
some nameless rencontre in the Irish wars, sealing by a
warrior's fate a course of long tried and devoted attachment
to his king; in his death, as in his life, affording a memorable
illustration of the fine sentiment embodied in these proud
lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"Master! lead on and I will follow thee<br />
To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty."<br />
</div>

<p>During the Protectorate of Cromwell, Briggs ruled in the
ascendancy; but on the accession of Charles the Second, he
was obliged for a long period to hide in the wilds of Furness.</p>

<p>Two hundred years have rolled away, since the generation
that saw those events has vanished from the earth, and every
tangible memorial of the island hero has been thought to have
perished with him. Nevertheless, time has spared one fragile,
though little noticed relic; for in the library of that most
interesting of our northern English fanes, the Parish Church
of Cartmel, whose age-stricken walls, so rich in examples of
each style of Gothic architecture, rise but a few miles from the
foot of the lake, in the centre of a vale of much beauty of a
monastic character, there is retained upon the shelves a small
volume in Latin, entitled "Vincentii Lirinensis hæres, Oxoniæ,
1631," on one of the blank leaves of which is this inscription
in MS., the signature to which has been partly torn off:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
"For Mr Rob. Philipson.<br />
Inveniam, spero, quamvis Peregrinus, amicos:<br />
Mite peto tecum cominus hospitium. R&mdash;&mdash;"<br />
</div>

<p>It is pleasing to dwell on this enduring testimony of regard
for a man, whose portrait, as limned on the historic canvas, has
hitherto been looked upon as that only of a bold unnurtured
ruffler in an age of strife. Seen under the effect of this touch
by the hand of friendship, a gentler grace illumes the air of one,
whose unwavering principles and firm temper well fitted him
to encounter the troubles of a stormy epoch, while, as long as
the island itself shall endure, his heroic shadow rising over its
groves, will cast the enthralling interest of a romantic episode
upon a scene so captivating by its natural loveliness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>
<p>That the individual so addressed, was our Robin of Satanic
notoriety, there cannot reasonably be a doubt, as the pedigree
of the Crook Hall Philipsons does not recognise any other
member of the family of that name, living between the time of
the publication of the book, and the death of their last male
heir. Neither is the genealogical tree of the Calgarth branch
enriched with the name between that and 1652, when
Christopher Philipson (of the house of Calgarth) who, amid
the bitter struggle of parties, seems to have been devoted to
the cultivation of letters, and who is supposed to have presented
the book, along with others, to the library at Cartmel,
died. Therefore to the successful soldier, whose actions gave
to himself and his cause so chivalrous a colouring, alone, must
the inscription be applied, the evidence it affords furnishing
another illustration of the saying that "the Devil is not always
as black as he is painted." But whether it be questionable
that it was directed to the royalist Robin, or not, the
probability is sufficiently great to justify what has been said
on the subject.</p>

<p>Recent research through public archives has ascertained
that the family of the Philipsons was established in Westmorland
at least as far back as the reign of Edward III., for in an
inquisition relative to the possessions of the chantry on Saint
Mary's Holme, taken in 1355, the name of John Philipson is
recorded as tenant to certain lands belonging to that religious
foundation.</p>

<p>This family owned not only Calgarth Hall and extensive
domains which reached along the shores of Windermere, from
Low Wood to Rayrigg, consisting of beautiful woods and rich
pastures, but also Crook and Holling Halls, with much of the
surrounding country, as well as the large island in the centre
of the lake, opposite to Bowness, in documents of the 13th
century especially designated "Le Holme," but the earliest
name of which was Wynandermere Isle, afterwards changed
to the "Long Holme," which latter word signifies, in the old
vernacular, "an island or plain by the water side," and in
which they had a mansion of the old fashioned Westmorland
kind, strongly fortified, called the Holme House.</p>

<p>Their alliances having connected them with many of the
chief families of the county, they fixed their principal dwelling
places at Holling, and at Crook or Thwatterden Halls; which
latter abode in the time of Queen Elizabeth again became the
seat of a younger branch of the house at Calgarth.</p>

<p>With Sir Christopher Philipson, the last heir male of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>family of Crook Hall, who, according to Mr. West, lived in
the Holme in 1705, and who died in that year, the race was
extinguished. Their mouldered dust lies beneath the pavement
in Windermere Church, and their homes, for the most
part but grey and naked ruins, know them no more.</p></blockquote>

<h2>THE LAY OF LORD LUCY OF
EGREMOND.</h2>

<div class="poem">
On that Mount surnamed "of Sorrow"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glass'd in Enna's winding flood,</span><br />
Looking forth through many a morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Both the warriors, Lucies, stood;</span><br />
Stood beside the ramparts hoary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brothers, vow'd their brows to wreathe</span><br />
In the Holy Land with glory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or its sands to rest beneath.</span><br />
<br />
Quietly the vale was lying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Farm and meadow, forge and mill,</span><br />
As the day-star faintly dying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Paled above the eastern hill.</span><br />
But beneath the cullis'd portal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Press'd the pent-up throng of war,</span><br />
Eager for the strife immortal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the Soldan's hosts afar.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span><br />
Fame has all his soul's embraces&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Clasps Lord Lucy maid nor wife.</span><br />
As the warriors' vizor'd faces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn towards the land of strife.</span><br />
Through the gate beneath the towering<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pile they wind in shining mail.</span><br />
Soon afar the fortress lowering<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sinks beneath them in the vale.</span><br />
<br />
Scawfell saw them take the billow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Man by man on Cumbria's shore;</span><br />
Carmel's foot was first their pillow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When again to land they bore.</span><br />
And in holy fight they bound them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To their Saviour's service true;</span><br />
Fought and bled, through hosts around them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till their ranks were faint and few.</span><br />
<br />
Then beneath the foe contending,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faithful, fearless, but in vain,</span><br />
Lo, the brothers bound and bending<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drag the hopeless captive's chain.</span><br />
In the Moslem dungeon wasting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">England's bravest, both they lie;</span><br />
No sweet hope nor solace tasting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only blank captivity.</span><br />
<br />
Months have rolled; and moons are waning;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then stood Lucy forth and said,&mdash;</span><br />
"Emir, over millions reigning!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We are two in dungeon laid.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>I, who bore a noble's banner,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I have halls and realms afar,</span><br />
Wealth which many a lordly manor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yields, beneath the western star.</span><br />
<br />
"Let the Emir's heart be gracious!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Free my brother at my side;</span><br />
And a ransom rich and precious<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We will bring o'er ocean wide.</span><br />
So we two, whose arms avail'd not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here our freedom to sustain,</span><br />
But whose constant courage fail'd not,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May be Freedom's sons again."</span><br />
<br />
Greed for gain o'er wrath prevailing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Softened soon the tyrant's mind.</span><br />
Homewards one is swiftly sailing;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Calmly one will wait behind.</span><br />
For a twelve-months thus they parted.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Weary months, the year, went o'er.</span><br />
But that brother, evil-hearted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the West return'd no more.</span><br />
<br />
Then the Emir's soul no longer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would its vengeance stern forego;</span><br />
All his rage suppress'd the stronger,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burn'd, and burst upon his foe.</span><br />
And he bade his hair be knotted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into cords around a beam,</span><br />
There to chain him till he rotted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where no light of heaven could gleam.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span><br />
And in hunger sore he wasted;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And his nails grew like a bird's;</span><br />
Day's sweet blesséd airs untasted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And no sound of human words!</span><br />
Changed in soul, and form, and feature,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! how changed from that fair mould.</span><br />
In which heaven had stamped its creature<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Man and warrior, mild as bold!</span><br />
<br />
Yet one heart whose daily gladness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once had been, from latticed bower</span><br />
To look down on him in sadness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walking forth at evening hour;</span><br />
She, the Emir's fairest daughter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sees brave Lucy now no more,&mdash;</span><br />
Till unresting love has brought her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Trembling to his dungeon's floor.</span><br />
<br />
There, with one mute form attending,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swift her arm the faulchion drew</span><br />
Through his locks; the hatterel rending<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From him, as it cleaved them through.</span><br />
And with words of woman-kindness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whisper'd she&mdash;"To light and air,</span><br />
Life and love, from dungeon blindness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Are we come the brave to bear."</span><br />
<br />
And for love of him she bore him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a ship, wherein he rode</span><br />
Seaward till the bright sky o'er him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Circled round his own abode.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>Then his castle-horn he sounded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which none other's skill could sound,</span><br />
Where the traitor sat, confounded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With his bold retainers round.</span><br />
<br />
But brave Lucy's soul forgave him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All that wrong so foully done;</span><br />
Him who went not back to save him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the ransom he had won.</span><br />
Yea, and more: "From Duddon's borders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Far as Esk, and from the sea</span><br />
To where Hard-knott's ancient warders<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sleep," he said, "I give to thee.</span><br />
<br />
"Here once more by vale and mountain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On these ramparts side by side,</span><br />
Wells up from my heart a fountain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wastes and dungeons have not dried."</span><br />
And his stately halls he entered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne mid cheers and warriors' clang;</span><br />
While a thousand welcomes, centred<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In one shout of triumph, rang.</span><br />
<br />
High the feast and great the story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then that fill'd his ancient halls.</span><br />
Healths to Lucy's House and glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shook the banners on the walls.</span><br />
And their deep foundations hail'd him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With such echoes as were born</span><br />
When his own true breath avail'd him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the faithful Castle-horn.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span><br />
And 'twas joy again to wander<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On his own fair fields, and chase</span><br />
There the wild wolf, and bring under<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The strong deer in deadly race.</span><br />
And if sometimes more the forest<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Won him, museful and alone;</span><br />
'Twas when secret thoughts were sorest.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn'd upon the past and gone.</span><br />
<br />
But that lone and lordly bosom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sought no mate of high degree;</span><br />
Wooed no fair and beauteous blossom<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From a noble kindred tree,&mdash;</span><br />
As might have beseem'd, to wear her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Throned within a warrior's breast;</span><br />
Evermore to bloom, the sharer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of its love, its life, its rest.</span><br />
<br />
So in field, and hall, and tourney,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As he lived&mdash;upon a day,</span><br />
Wearied with a toilsome journey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Came a guest from far away;</span><br />
Feebly at his gate and humbly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Asking, "Dwells Lord Lucy here?"</span><br />
But all question parried dumbly,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till the voice she sought was near.</span><br />
<br />
Then indeed the sorrow-laden,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Travel-stricken form sunk down;</span><br />
Slow the hatterel forth the maiden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drew; he knew her! 'twas his own!</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>Knew her, as she stood before him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On that barren Syrian shore,</span><br />
When from wrath and death she bore him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where no wrong might touch him more.</span><br />
<br />
Bear her in! he tells them of her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tells them all with eyeballs dim.</span><br />
Cannot be but he must love her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For she bears such love to him.</span><br />
She has left her father's mansion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Left her country, faith, and name,</span><br />
Travell'd o'er the sea's expansion,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Him to find in life and fame.</span><br />
<br />
Was there ever like devotion?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is he husband, father; she</span><br />
Who has braved the boundless ocean<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will his serving maiden be.</span><br />
No! she shall abide in honour,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One for ever at his side;</span><br />
Every gift and grace upon her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That beseems a warrior's bride.</span><br />
<br />
Then again his days were gladden'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With more joys than e'er of yore.</span><br />
And if thought at times was sadden'd<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the memories which it bore,</span><br />
Clasping oft his wife with true love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He would say with whispering breath&mdash;</span><br />
"Love is life indeed! for through love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I am here, reprieved from death!"</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span><br />
And his soul's allegiance fail'd not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That fair consort, all his days.</span><br />
And their blissful love&mdash;avail'd not<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chance or time to quench its rays.</span><br />
Love unto his gate had brought her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the seas from far beyond.</span><br />
And with love the Emir's daughter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ruled the halls of Egremond.</span><br />
<br />
But that kinsman, far divided<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From them by remorse and shame,</span><br />
Round his courts in secret glided<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ghost-like&mdash;nevermore the same:</span><br />
Conscience-torn, repentant, weary,<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "THE LAY OF LORD LUCY OF
EGREMOND."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>The name of Egremont seems to be derived from its ancient
possessors, the Normans, and being changed by a trifling
corruption of their language, carries the same meaning, and
signifies the Mount of Sorrow.</p>

<p>The charter of Richard de Lucy, granted to the burgesses
in the time of King John, declares it to be given and confirmed
"burgensibus meis de <i>Acrimonte</i>," &amp;c.</p>

<p>William the Conqueror having established himself on the
throne of England, and added the county of Cumberland,
which he wrested from Malcolm, king of Scotland, to his
northern possessions; he gave it, together with the barony of
Westmorland, to Randolph or Ranulph du Briquesard, also
surnamed le Meschin, Vicomte du Bessin, elder brother of
William le Meschin. This nobleman was allied to the
Conqueror by marriage with his niece, and was one of his
numerous train of military adventurers. He was the first
Norman paramount feudatory of Cumberland. When Ranulph
granted out to his several retainers their respective allotments;
reserving to himself the forest of Inglewood, he gave to his
brother, William le Meschin, the great barony of Copeland,
bounded by the rivers Duddon and Derwent, and the sea.
The latter seated himself at Egremont and there erected a
castle; and in distinction of this his baronial seat, he changed
the name of the whole territory to that of the barony of Egremont.
After possessing this estate with great power for
several years, and dying without male issue, it devolved to his
daughter Alice, married to Robert de Romili, Lord of Skipton.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>They having no male issue, these two great baronies descended
to their only daughter Alice, who married William Fitz-Duncan,
Earl of Murray, nephew to David, King of Scots.
By this marriage there was issue a son, who died in infancy,
and three daughters who divided the vast inheritance. To
Amabil, the second daughter, the barony of Egremont came
in partition; and by her marriage with Reginald Lucy, passed
to that family. William Fitz-Duncan was Lord of the
adjoining Cumbrian seigniory or honor of Cockermouth, and
of the barony of Allerdale below Derwent, which large estates
had descended to him from his mother Octreda, who inherited
them from her grandfather Waldeof, first lord of Allerdale, to
whom they had been granted by Ranulph de Meschin.
Waldeof was the son of Gospatrick, Earl of Dunbar.</p>

<p>Particular mention is made of two only of the name of Lucy
in succession: Reginald de Lucy, who was governor of
Nottingham for the King, in the rebellion of the Earl of
Leicester, and who also attended the coronation of Richard I.
among the other Barons; and Richard de Lucy, his son, who,
in the reign of King John, paid a fine of three hundred marks
for the livery of all his lands in Coupland and Canteberge,
<i>and to have the liberty of marrying whom he pleased</i>, &amp;c. He
married Ada, one of the two daughters and co-heiresses of
Hugh de Morville; and obtained a grant from King John, by
which he claimed and held the whole property of his father-in-law,
without partition to the other daughter, Joane. He
died before or about the 15th year of King John, leaving two
daughters, between whom the estates were divided, and who
both married into the Multon family.</p>

<p>At that time, and long after, it was a part of the King's
prerogative to interfere in the marriages of his nobility.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>The subsequent acts of the widowed Ada de Lucy afford us
a fine illustration of the exercise of this prerogative on the
part of the sovereign in the matters of widows and heiresses.
Ada paid a fine of five hundred marks for livery of her
inheritance; as also for dowry of her late husband's lands;
and that she might not be compelled to marry again. She
espoused, however, without compulsion, and without the
king's licence, Thomas de Multon; in consequence of which,
the Castle of Egremont, and her other lands, were seized by
the Crown. But upon paying a compensation, they were
restored, and she had livery of them again. Her second
husband, on his payment of one thousand marks to the crown,
was made guardian over the two daughters, and co-heiresses,
of her first husband, de Lucy: and as a necessary consequence,
and, in fact, in accordance with the permission implied by the
arrangement, he married them to his two sons by his first
wife.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>These two daughters and co-heiresses of Lucy having
married the two sons of Thomas de Multon, the elder carried
with her the lordship of Egremont; while the son of the
younger assumed the surname of his maternal family, and was
ancestor of the barons Lucy of Cockermouth. The infant
daughter of Anthony, the third and last baron Lucy, dying in
the year following his own demise, the barony was carried by
the marriage of his sister Maude with the first Earl of Northumberland
to the Percy family: thence to the Seymours,
Dukes of Somerset; and through them to Wyndham, Earl of
Egremont, by whose descendant, the first Lord Leconfield, it
is at present enjoyed.</p>

<p>Egremont was anciently a borough, sending two members
to parliament; but was disfranchised on the petition of the
burgesses, to avoid the expense of representation. The
burgesses possessed several privileges, but all records of them
are lost. The ordinances of Richard de Lucy for the government
of the borough is a curious record, in which several
singularities are to be observed, which point out to us the
customs of that distant age. By this burgage tenure, the people
of Egremont were obliged to find armed men, for the defence of
the Castle, forty days at their own charge. The lord was
entitled to forty days' credit for goods, and no more; and his
burgesses might refuse to supply him, till the debt which had
exceeded that date was paid. They were bound to aids for
the redemption of the lord and his heir from captivity; for the
knighthood of one of the lord's sons, and the marriage of one
of his daughters. They were to find him twelve men for his
military array. They were to hold watch and ward. They
could not enter the forest with bow and arrow. They were
relieved from cutting off the dogs' feet within the borough,
as being a necessary and customary defence: on the borders,
the dogs appointed to be kept for defence, were called <i>slough
dogs</i>: this privilege points out, that within the limits of
forests, the inhabitants keeping dogs for defence were to lop
off one foot or more, to prevent their chasing the game; which
did not spoil them for the defence of a dwelling. A singular
privilege appears in the case of a burgess committing fornication
with the daughter of a rustic, one who was not a burgess;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>that he should not be liable to the fine imposed in other cases
for that offence, unless he had seduced by promise of marriage.
The fine for seducing a woman belonging to the borough was
three shillings to the lord. By the rule for inspecting dyers,
weavers, and fullers, it seems those were the only trades at
that time within the borough under the character of craftsmen.
The burgesses who had ploughs were to till the lord's
demesne one day in the year, and every burgess to find a
reaper: their labour was from morning <i>ad nonam</i>, which was
three o'clock, as from six to three.</p>

<p>Egremont was probably a place of strength, and the seat of
some powerful chief, during the Heptarchy, and in the time
of the Danes. The ruins of the Castle, on the west of the
town, stand on an eminence, the northern extremity of which
forms a lofty mound, seventy-eight feet in perpendicular
height above the ditch which surrounds the fortress. On the
crown of this hill, it is believed, there formerly stood a Danish
fortification. The mound is said to be artificial. Tradition
goes so far as to assert that it is formed of soil brought by St.
Bega from Ireland, as ballast for her ship. The miraculous
power of the Saint must have been largely exercised to
increase it to its present proportions. It still, however,
retains the virtue given to Irish earth by the blessing of St.
Patrick, and no reptile can live upon it.</p>

<p>This fortress is not of very great extent, but bears singular
marks of antiquity and strength. The approach and grand
entrance from the south, has been kept by a draw-bridge over
a deep moat. The entrance to the castle is by a gateway
vaulted with semi-circular arches, and guarded by a strong
tower. The architecture of this tower, which is the chief
part of the fortress now standing, points out its antiquity to be
at least coeval with the entry of the Normans. The outward
wall has enclosed a considerable area of a square form; but it
is now gone so much to decay, that no probable conjecture
can be made as to the particular manner in which it was
fortified. On the side next the town a postern remains. To
the westward, from the area, there is an ascent to three narrow
gates, standing close together, and on a straight line, which
have communicated with the outworks: these are apparently
of more modern architecture, and have each been defended
with a portcullis. Beyond these gates is the lofty mount,
which has already been referred to, and on which anciently
stood a circular tower, the western side of which endured the
rage of time till within the last century. The whole fortification
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>is surrounded by a moat, more properly so called than
a ditch, as it appears to have been walled on both sides. This
is strengthened with an outward rampart of earth, which is
five hundred paces in circumference. A small brook runs on
the eastern side of the Castle, and it may be presumed,
anciently filled the moat. The mode of building which
appears in part of the walls, is rather uncommon, the construction
being of large thin stones, placed in an inclined
position, the courses lying in different directions, so as to form
a kind of feathered work, the whole run together with lime
and pebbles, impenetrably strong. It seems to have been
copied from the filling parts of the Roman wall.</p>

<p>An old tradition connects the lords of this Castle with the
Crusades. One version of it given in the histories of Cumberland,
for it is variously related, is to this effect:&mdash;"The
Baron of Egremont being taken prisoner beyond the seas by
the infidels, could not be redeemed without a great ransom,
and being for England, entered his brother or kinsman for his
surety, promising with all possible speed to send him money
to set him free; but upon his return home to Egremont, he
changed his mind, and most unnaturally and unthankfully
suffered his brother to lie in prison, in great distress and
extremity, until the hair was grown to an unusual length, like
to a woman's hair. The Pagans being out of hopes of the
ransom, in great rage most cruelly hanged up their pledge,
binding the long hair of his head to a beam in the prison,
and tied his hands so behind him, that he could not reach to
the top where the knot was fastened to loose himself: during
his imprisonment, the Paynim's daughter became enamoured
of him, and sought all good means for his deliverance, but
could not enlarge him: she understanding of this last cruelty,
by means made to his keeper, entered the prison, and taking
her knife to cut the hair, being hastened, she cut the skin of
his head, so as, with the weight of his body, he rent away the
rest, and fell down to the earth half dead; but she presently
took him up, causing surgeons to attend him secretly, till he
recovered his former health, beauty, and strength, and so
entreated her father for him that he set him at liberty. Then,
desirous to revenge his brother's ingratitude, he got leave to
depart to his country, and took home with him the hatterell
of his hair rent off as aforesaid, and a bugle-horn, which he
commonly used to carry about him, when he was in England,
where he shortly arrived, and coming to Egremont Castle
about noontide of the day, where his brother was at dinner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>he blew his bugle-horn, which (says the tradition) his brother
the baron presently acknowledged, and thereby conjectured
his brother's return; and then sending his friends and servants
to learn his brother's mind to him, and how he had escaped,
they brought back the report of all the miserable torment
which he had endured for his unfaithful brother the baron,
which so astonished the baron (half dead before with the
shameful remembrance of his own disloyalty and breach of
promise) that he abandoned all company and would not look
on his brother, till his just wrath was pacified by diligent
entreaty of their friends. And to be sure of his brother's
future kindness, he gave the <i>lordship of Millum</i> to him and
his heirs for ever. Whereupon the first Lords of Millum gave
for their arms <i>the horn and the hatterell</i>.</p>

<p>Others relate that it was the baron who remained as hostage:
and that on his release from captivity by the Paynim's
daughter, and after his departure to his native country, urged
by her love towards him, she found her way across the sea,
and presenting herself at his castle-gate, with the hatterell of
his hair which she had preserved as a token, was joyfully
recognized by the Baron, who made her his wife and the
mistress of his halls.</p>

<p>It is, on various grounds, an anachronism to refer this
tradition to the period when the Lucies were Lords of
Egremont. For, according to Denton, the great seignory of
Millom "in the time of King Henry I. was given by William
Meschines, Lord of Egremont, to ... de Boyvill, father
to Godard de Boyvill, named in ancient evidences Godardus
Dapifer." This accords with the tradition, which is very old,
and is given by both Denton and Sandford, and which
makes, as we have seen, the Boyvills to be very near of kin to
the Lords of Egremont. It also particularises the occasion
upon which Millom was transferred to that family; who took
their surname from the place, and were styled de-Millom.</p>

<p>That some members of the family were engaged in the
crusades, we learn from the record that Arthur Boyvill or de
Millom, the third lord, and the son of Godardus Dapifer,
granted to the Abbey of St. Mary in Furness the services of
Kirksanton in Millom, which Robert de Boyvill, his cousin-german,
then held of him; and soon after he mortgaged the
same to the Abbot of Furness, until his return from the Holy
Land.</p>

<p>The crest of Huddleston of Hutton John is, Two arms,
dexter and sinister embowed, vested, argent, holding in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>hands a scalp proper, the inside gules. The tradition of the
Horn of Egremont Castle, which could only be sounded by
the rightful lord, and which forms the subject of a fine poem
by Mr. Wordsworth, is said properly to belong to Hutton-John,
an ancient manor of the Huddlestons, who were
descended from the Boyvills in the female line; Joan, the
daughter and heiress of the last of the de-Milloms, in the
reign of Henry III., having married Sir John Hudleston, Kt.;
and thus transferred the seignory into that family, with whom
it continued for a period of about 500 years.</p>

<p>The name of Egremont will remind the poetical reader of
the story of the "Youthful Romili," celebrated by Wordsworth
in his noble ballad "The Founding of Bolton Priory," and
by Rogers in his less ambitious lines "The Boy of Egremond."
It seems to be by no means certain to which generation of
William le Meschines' descendants the tale belongs. Denton
says, "Alice Romley, the third daughter and co-heir of
William Fitz-Duncan, was the fourth lady of Allerdale: but
having no children alive at her death, she gave away divers
manors and lands to houses of religion, and to her friends and
kinsmen. She had a son named William, who was drowned
in Craven coming home from hunting or hawking. His hound
or spaniel being tied to his girdle by a line, (as they crossed
the water near Barden Tower, in Craven) pulled his master
from off his horse and drowned him. When the report of his
mischance came to his mother, she answered, "<i>Bootless bayl
brings endless sorrow</i>." She had also three daughters, Alice,
Avice, and Mavice, who all died unmarried, and without
children; wherefore the inheritance was after her death
parted between the house of Albemarl and Reginald Lucy,
Baron of Egremont, descending to her sister's children and
their posterity."</p>

<p>This is Whitaker's statement:&mdash;"In the year 1121 William
le Meschines and Cecilia his wife founded a Priory for canons
regular, at Embsay, which was dedicated to St. Mary and St.
Cuthbert, and continued there about thirty-three years, when
it is said by tradition to have been translated to Bolton, on
the following account.</p>

<p>"The founders of Embsay were now dead, and had left a
daughter, who adopted her mother's name, Romillé, and was
married to William Fitz-Duncan. They had issue a son,
commonly called the Boy of Egremond (one of his grandfather's
baronies, where he was probably born), who, surviving
an elder brother, became the last hope of the family.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>
<p>"In the deep solitude of the woods betwixt Bolton and
Barden, the Wharf suddenly contracts itself to a rocky channel
little more than four feet wide, and pours through the
tremendous fissure with a rapidity proportionate to its confinement.
This place was then, as it is yet, called the Strid, from
a feat often exercised by persons of more agility than prudence,
who stride from brink to brink, regardless of the destruction
which awaits a faltering step. Such, according to tradition,
was the fate of young Romillé, who inconsiderately bounding
over the chasm with a greyhound in his leash, the animal
hung back, and drew his unfortunate master into the torrent.
The forester, who accompanied Romillé, and beheld his fate,
returned to the Lady Aäliza, and, with despair in his countenance,
enquired, 'What is good for a bootless Bene?' To
which the mother, apprehending that some great calamity had
befallen her son, instantly replied, 'Endless Sorrow.'</p>

<p>"The language of this question, almost unintelligible at
present, proves the antiquity of the story, which nearly
amounts to proving its truth. But 'bootless Bene' is
unavailing prayer; and the meaning, though imperfectly
expressed, seems to have been, 'What remains when prayer
is useless?'"</p>

<p>The accuracy of this account, though admitted to be true so
far as the death of a scion of Romili's house, is however
doubted by Dr. Whitaker, who states that the son of the Lady
Alice or Aäliza was a party and witness to the charter of
translation to Bolton in 1154 of the Canons of the Priory of
Embsay, founded in 1121 by William de Meschines and
Cecilia de Romili his wife. Besides, as the Boy of Egremond
was alive in 1160, and a partaker in the rebellion of the Pictish
Celts of Scotland, of which the object was to set him on the
throne as the rightful heir, Dr. Whitaker is of opinion that
the story refers to one of the sons (both of whom died young)
of Cecilia le Meschines, grandmother of Lady Alice.</p>

<p>There is however an oversight of some importance in
Whitaker's statement. He altogether omits the second
generation of the descendants of William le Meschines.
Alice, the daughter of W. le Meschines, married Robert de
Romili; Alice, her daughter, married Fitz-Duncan, who
assumed the name of his wife, and was William le Romili.
If their son was "the Boy of Egremond," he could not have
been a witness to the charter of translation in 1154. If he
was drowned in the Wharf, his death could not have been the
occasion of the refounding of the Priory at Bolton. If the son
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>of Cecilia le Meschines was "the Boy of Egremond"; as he
might be so styled from his father's barony; he may have been
drowned at the Strid, but his mother could not have been the
second foundress of the Priory; for, as Whitaker says, the
founders of Embsay were already dead. Tradition, moreover,
clings to the name of the Lady Alice, as being that of the
pious dispenser of her goods to sacred and religious uses.
And however history may conflict with tradition, there will
remain, that the Lady of Skipton, Cockermouth, and the
Allerdales, bestowed her lands and goods most liberally upon
the Abbeys of Fountains and Pomfret, and other religious
confraternities; that she, the Lady Alice, seems always to
have cherished those dispositions whose spiritual convictions
moved in unison with the votive religious practices of the age;
and although she, for the health of her dear son's soul (if he it
were who perished in the Wharf) could not have founded
near the scene of his untimely fate, the Priory before mentioned;
its legendary history, which has so enshrined her
affections and her sorrows, will continue to connect in the
future, as in the past, the image of the youthful Romili with
her griefs, and the stately Priory of Bolton with his imperishable
name.</p></blockquote>

<h2>SÖLVAR-HOW.</h2>

<div class="poem">
Up the valley of Brathay rode Dagmar the Dane.<br />
There was gold on her bit, there was silk on her rein.<br />
You might see her white steed in the distance afar,<br />
On the green-breasted hill, shining out like a star;<br />
Where beyond her on high in his barrow lay sleeping<br />
Old Sölvar the chief; and the shade, that sat keeping<br />
His fame, by his tomb sang the Norseland's wild strain.<br />
<br />
As the white steed of Dagmar shone, breasting the hill;<br />
To the mound where old Sölvar lies lonely and still,<br />
In the red light of evening, arresting her gaze,<br />
Flocked the meek mountain ewes and the steers up the ways,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>With the firstlings and yearlings, from hill top and hollow,<br />
Gathering far, the sweet voice of the Phantom to follow&mdash;<br />
To them sweeter than murmur of fountain and rill.<br />
<br />
There was joy in their looks, in their eyes the clear light<br />
Glistened searchingly forth on that mystical sight.<br />
And from far, too, the white steed of Dagmar the Dane<br />
Pricked his ears, stepping proudly, unheeding the rein;<br />
And aside to the summit turned joyfully pacing;<br />
While the steers and the ewes listened wistfully gazing,<br />
And the Phantom sat singing of Sölvar the Bright.<br />
<br />
O'er the pools of the Brathay, from Skelwith's lone tower<br />
The sire of the princess looked forth in that hour.<br />
He beheld the white steed of his child, like a star<br />
On the green-breasted hill, and he cried from afar&mdash;<br />
"She has heard his wild strains on the hill-top awaken,<br />
And I from this hour am alone and forsaken.<br />
&mdash;Not her voice nor her foot-fall, to come to me more!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span><br />
For to Dagmar the fair, when the flocks of the field<br />
And the herds were in motion their homage to yield<br />
To the bright Norseland Boy&mdash;with the fire and the grace<br />
Of his sires in his limbs and their pride in his face&mdash;<br />
In the garb of his country, rehearsing the story<br />
Of chiefs and of kings and the Norseland's old glory&mdash;<br />
Was the Phantom in all his bright beauty revealed.<br />
<br />
There entranced in that vision, enchained by his tongue,<br />
As the strains through his harp-strings melodiously rung,<br />
Sat the maid on White Svend mid the yearlings; till now<br />
Far departing he turns from the hill's sunny brow;<br />
And the ewes at his feet awhile falteringly follow,<br />
Then range back bewildered to hill-top and hollow;<br />
While the Maid on his fast-fading accents still hung.<br />
<br />
Through the still light receding his loose tresses streamed;<br />
But to fly with him still was the dream she had dreamed;<br />
Side by side o'er the hills, through the valleys, and on<br />
To the Norseland to hear his wild songs all alone;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>And to chase from his lips every accent of sorrow,<br />
As they walked through the dawn of a brighter to-morrow<br />
Into sunlight that heaven upon earth never beamed.<br />
<br />
Springing down from White Svend, swiftly Dagmar the Dane<br />
Cast aside on his neck the rich silk-tassel'd rein;<br />
With her eyes fixed afar o'er the green mountain sward,<br />
Whence the bright Norseland Boy cast a backward regard.<br />
Call aloud from thy Tower, call aloud and implore her,<br />
Hapless sire! to return, ere the night gathers o'er her!<br />
She can hear but the voice of the Phantom's sweet strain.<br />
<br />
Light and fleet was her foot over hollow and hill;<br />
Till they reached the rude cleft of the deep-roaring Ghyll.<br />
On the black dungeon's brink not a moment he stay'd;<br />
O'er the black roaring Ghyll glided softly the Shade.<br />
Like a thin wreath of mist she descried him far over&mdash;<br />
And her cry pierced the night-boding hill tops above her;<br />
When down the loose rocks plunged, and bridged the dark Ghyll.<br />
<br />
Heard the eagle that shriek from his eyrie on high?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span><br />
Struck his wings the poised rocks as he rushed to the sky?<br />
Did the wild goat leap, startled, and press from their hold<br />
With his hoof the loose crags?&mdash;that they bounded and roll'd<br />
Far above, down, and on, soughing, plunging, and clashing,<br />
Till they reached the dark Ghyll, and fell, wedging and crashing,<br />
In the gulf's horrid jaws, there for ever to lie.<br />
<br />
The fleet foot of Dagmar sprang light to the stone,<br />
Where it bridged the dread gulf, in the twilight, alone.<br />
For one moment she stood with her eyes straining o'er<br />
Into space, for the bright one that answered no more.<br />
He was gone from the hand she stretched, vainly imploring;<br />
He was gone from the heart that beat, madly adoring:<br />
And a voice from the waters cried wailingly&mdash;"Gone."<br />
<br />
Roar thou on, Dungeon-Ghyll! there was mourning in vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span><br />
In the fortress of Skelwith for Dagmar the Dane.<br />
From their tower on the cliff they looked, tearful and pale,<br />
On her riderless steed as it came down the vale.<br />
In her bower and in hall there was wailing and sorrow.<br />
And the hills shone renewed with each glorious to-morrow.<br />
But their bright star, their Dagmar, they knew not again.<br />

<h3>NOTES TO "SÖLVAR HOW."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>While many Celtic names of places remain to attest the
prolonged sovereignty of the Britons in Cumbria, by far the
greater number refer to a period when the enterprising
Northmen, coming from various shores, but all included
under the comprehensive title of Danes, had pushed their
conquests into the mountain country of Cumberland and
Westmorland and those portions of the north of Lancashire,
which are comprised within the district of the English Lakes.
This territory had become the exclusive possession of the
Norwegian settlers. Every height and how, every lake and
tarn, every swamp and fountain, every ravine and ghyll, every
important habitation on the mountain side, the dwelling place
amidst the cleared land in the forest, the narrow dell, the
open valley, every one is associated with some fine old name
that belonged to our Scandinavian forefathers. Silver How
is the hill of Sölvar, and Butter-lip-how, the mound of
Buthar, surnamed Lepr the Nimble; Windermere and Buttermere,
and Elter-water are the meres and water called
after the ancient Norsemen, Windar, and Buthar or Butar,
and Eldir, Gunnerskeld, and Ironkeld, and Butter-eld-keld,
are the spring or marsh of Gunnar, and Hiarn, and Buthar
the Old, or Elder. Bekangs-Ghyll, and Staingill, and Thortillgill,
indicate the ravines or fissures, which were probably at
one time the boundaries respectively of the lands of Bekan,
and Steini, and Thortil; Seatallau and Seatoller were once
the dwelling places whence Elli and Oller looked on the
plains below them; and in Ormthwaile, and Branthwaite,
and Gillerthwaite we recognise the lands cleared amid the
forests with the axe, whose several possessors were Ormr, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>Biorn, and Geller; while Borrodale, and Ennerdale, and
Riggindale, and Bordale recall the days when these remote
valleys were subject to the lordly strangers Borrhy, and Einar,
and Regin, and Bor. All these names are Scandinavian proper
names, and are to be found in the language of that ancient
race, of whose sojourn amongst our hills so many traces remain
in the nomenclature of the district.</p>

<p>Coming from the wildest and poorest part of the Norwegian
coast, and mixing with the Celtic tribes of these regions, in
the early ages; those hardy sons of the sea made extensive
and permanent settlements among them. They penetrated
into the remotest recesses of the mountains, carrying thither
their wild belief in the old northern gods, and their rude ideas
of a future life. Their warlike recollections, and their attachment
to the scenes of their valorous exploits, fostered the
notion which was not uncommon among them, that the spirits
of chieftains could sometimes leave the halls of Valhalla, and,
seated each on his own sepulchral hill, could look around him
on the peaceful land over which in life he had held rule, or
on that beloved sea which had borne him so often to war and
conquest. It was this thought that induced them to select for
their burial places high mountains, or elevated spots in the
valleys and plains. As a natural result of their long continued
dominion in the North of England, they came to be classed
in the imagination of the people with invisible and mystic
beings which haunted that district. The shadows of the
remote old hills were the abodes of enchantment and superstition.
And the spirits of the departed were supposed to be
seen visiting the earth, sometimes in the guise of a Celtic
warrior careering on the wind, and sometimes in the form of
one of the old northern chieftains sitting solitary upon his
barrow. It is related of one being permitted to do so for the
purpose of comforting his disconsolate widow, and telling her
how much her sorrow disquieted him. Hence also the
dwellers among the hills, it is said, still fancy they hear on the
evening breeze musical tones as of harp strings played upon,
and melancholy lays in a foreign tongue; a beautiful concert,
to which we owe the exquisite medieval legend of the cattle,
in thraldom to the potent spirit of harmony that rings through
the air, often when no musical sound is audible to the organ
of man, pricking up their ears in astonishment, as they listen
to the Danish or Norseland Boy, sadly singing the old bardic
lays over the barrows of his once mighty forefathers.</p>

<p>It has been conjectured that the colonization of this district
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>by the Northmen was effected at two distinct periods, by two
separate streams of emigration, issuing from two different parts
of the Scandinavian shore. The first recorded invasion of
Cumberland by the Danes appears to have taken place about
the year 875; when an army under the command of Halfdene,
having entered Northumberland and made permanent settlements
there, commenced a series of incursions into the adjacent
countries lying on the north and west, and thereby reached the
borders of the lake region, first plundering them and finally
settling there. The indications of the presence of the northern
adventurers in that quarter are found to be more purely of a
Danish character than those which abound beyond the eastern
line of the district, and which may with great probability be
referred to a colonization more particularly Norwegian.</p>

<p>Our own histories make no mention of anything bearing
upon the subject, but there seem to be good reasons for
concluding that Cumberland was also invaded from the sea
coast. The Norwegian sea-rover Olaf, according to Snorro
Sturlessen, had visited, among other countries, both Cumberland
and Wales. And Mr. Ferguson supposes, from various
circumstances, which concur to fix the date of the Norwegian
settlements here in the interval between 945 and 1000, that
his descents must have taken place somewhere about the year
990. At that period the Cumbrian Britons had been for half
a century in subjugation to the Saxons, and since the death of
Dunmail their country had been handed over to Malcolm to be
held in fealty by the Scottish crown. The scattered remnants
of the Celtic tribes were for the most part shut up amongst
their hills, or had retired into Wales. The plains of Westmorland
and Cumberland on the north and east were probably
chiefly occupied by a mixed Saxon and Danish population;
for nearly a century had elapsed since the Danes from Northumberland
had overrun them. In fifty years more the result
of events was, as we are informed by Henry of Huntingdon,
that one of the principal abodes of the "Danes," under which
title old writers comprehend all Northmen, was in Cumberland.
A stream of Northern emigrants, issuing, it may be supposed,
from the districts of the Tellemark, and the Hardanger, a
name signifying "a place of hunger and poverty," had
descended along the north of Scotland, swept the western side
of the island, fixed its head-quarters in the Isle of Man, and
from thence succeeded in obtaining a firm footing upon the
opposite shore of England; a land, like their own, of mountains
and valleys, waiting for a people as they were for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>settlement, a wild and untamed country, always thinly populated
and never cultivated, a land of rocks and forests and of
desolation. These protected by their ships, having command
of the coast, and being unopposed except by the apparently
impenetrable mountain barriers before them, these warlike
settlers cleared for themselves homes amidst the woods, began
to gather tribute from the mountain sides, and laid the foundations
of those "thwaites" and "seats" and "gates" and
"garths," which at the end of almost nine centuries of
fluctuation and change still bear testimony to their wide-spread
rule and are called by their Northern names.</p>

<p>Not only do traces of them everywhere survive in names
which indicate possession and location, or in words which
particularise the multiform features of the country and describe
the minor variations of its surface; but the sites of their
legislative and judicial institutions, and their places of burial,
as well as their towns and villages, are preserved in that local
nomenclature which lives in the language spoken by their
kinsmen in the mother-land at the present day. The old
Norse element has penetrated, and diffused itself, and hardened
into the dialect of the Cumberland and Westmorland "fell-siders,"
and emphatically pronounces from whom it came.
And, lastly, the physical and moral characteristics, as well as
the manners and customs of the people, are those of the hardy
race, whose transmitted blood gave the larger nerve and more
enduring vigour which characterise their frame. Tall, bony,
and firmly knit; fair-haired, and of Sanguine complexion;
possessing strong feelings of independance, and a large share
of shrewdness and mother-wit; intolerant of oppression;
cautious, resolute, astute and brave; these people, and the
Cumbrians, especially, crown their list of claims to be of Norse
descent with one more striking feature, a litigious spirit.
Litigation appears to be almost as natural and necessary to
their minds, as wrestling and other manly exercises are to their
limbs: in respect to which, as well as to other amusements in
which they are said to bear some resemblance to the old Icelanders,
they bear away the palm from the rest of England.</p>

<p>Dungeon Ghyll in Great Langdale is a deep chasm or fissure
in the southern face of the first great buttress of the Pikes. It
is formed by a considerable stream from Pike o' Stickle;
which after making several fine leaps down the mountain side,
tumbles at length over a lofty precipice about eighty feet
between impending and perpendicular rocks into a deep and
gloomy basin. A few slender branches are seen springing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>from the crevices in either face of the chasm near the top; and
immediately above the basin, a natural arch, made by two
large stones which have rolled from a higher part of the
mountain, and got wedged together between the cheeks of
rock. By scrambling over some rough stones in the bed of
the stream, the largest and finest chamber may be reached;
and the visitor stands underneath the arch, and in front of the
waterfall. Over the bridge thus rudely formed, Wordsworth's
"Idle Shepherd Boy" challenged his comrade to pass; and
even ladies have had the intrepidity or temerity to cross it,
undeterred by the narrowness and awkwardness of the footing,
and the threatening aspect of the dismal gulf below.</p>

<p>The station in the field adjoining the farm house called
Skelwith-Fold, is the site where the Danish fortress is assumed
to have stood.</p></blockquote>

<h3>NOTES TO "THE CHURCH AMONG THE
MOUNTAINS."</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Wordsworth in his description of the Lake Country as it
was, and had been through centuries, till within about
one hundred years, thus alludes to the places of worship.
"Towards the head of these Dales was found a perfect
Republic of shepherds and agriculturists, among whom the
plough of each man was confined to the maintenance of his
own family, or to the occasional accommodation of his neighbour.
Two or three cows furnished each family with milk
and cheese. The Chapel was the only edifice that presided
over these dwellings, the supreme head of this pure commonwealth:
the members of which existed in the midst of a
powerful empire, like an ideal society or an organised
community, whose constitution had been imposed and
regulated by the mountains which protected it.</p>

<p>"The <i>religio loci</i> is nowhere violated by these unstinted,
yet unpretending works of human hands. They exhibit
generally a well proportioned oblong, with a suitable porch,
in some instances a steeple tower, and in others nothing more
than a small belfry, in which one or two bells hang visibly.
A man must be very insensible who would not have been
touched with pleasure at the sight of the former Chapel of
Buttermere, so strikingly expressing by its diminutive size,
how small must have been the congregation there assembled,
as it were, like one family; and proclaiming at the same time
to the passenger, in connection with the surrounding mountains,
the depth of that seclusion in which the people lived,
that rendered necessary the building of a separate place of
worship for so few. The edifice was scarcely larger than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>many of the single stones or fragments of rock which were
scattered near it. The old Chapel was perhaps the most
diminutive in all England, being incapable of receiving more
than half a dozen families. The length of the outer wall was
about seventeen feet. The curacy was 'certified to the
Governors of Queen Anne's Bounty at £1. paid by the
contributions of the inhabitants,' and it was also certified,
'this Chapel and Wythop were served by Readers, except
that the Curate of Lorton officiated there three or four times
in the year.'"</p>

<p>Such cures were held in these northern counties by unordained
persons, till about the middle of George II.'s reign;
when the Bishops came to a resolution, that no one should
officiate who was not in orders. But, because there would
have been some injustice and some hardship in ejecting the
existing incumbents, they were admitted to deacons' orders
without undergoing any examination. The person who was
then Reader as it was called, at the Chapel in the Vale of
Newlands, and who received this kind of ordination, exercised
the various trades of Clogger, Tailor, and Butter-print maker.</p>

<p>How otherwise than by following secular occupations were
even Readers to exist? The Chapel of "Secmurthow" on the
south side of the river Derwent, not far from the foot of
Bassenthwaite lake, was certified to the Governors of Queen
Anne's Bounty at £2., being the interest of £40. raised by the
inhabitants for a Reader. "Before its augmentation," says
Hutchinson, "the Reader of divine service had a precarious
income; but an actual custom existed for several years of
allowing the poor minister a <i>whittle-gate</i>. He was privileged
to go from house to house in the Chapelry, and stay a certain
number of days at each place, where he was permitted to enter
his <i>whittle</i> or knife with the rest of the family. This custom,"
he adds, "has been abolished in such modern times, that it is
in the memory of many now living." (i.e. 1794.)</p>

<p>The inhabitants of many of the Chapelries in the north got
by custom from the Rectors or Vicars the right of nominating
and presenting the curate; for this reason: before the death
of Queen Anne, many of the Chapelries were not worth above
two or three pounds a year, and the donees could not get
persons properly qualified to serve them; so they left them to
the inhabitants, who raised voluntary contributions for them
in addition to their salary, with clothes yearly and whittle-gate.</p>

<p>Clothes yearly, were one new suit of clothes, two pairs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>shoes, and one pair of clogs, shirts, stockings, etc., as they
could bargain.</p>

<p>Whittlegate is, to have two or three weeks' victuals at each
house, according to the ability of the inhabitants, which was
settled amongst them, so that he should go his course as
regularly as the sun, and complete it annually. Few houses
having more knives than one or two, the pastor was often
obliged to buy his own; sometimes it was bought for him by
the chapel-wardens. He marched from house to house with
his whittle seeking fresh pasturage; and as master of the herd,
he had the elbow chair at the table-head, which was often
made of part of a hollow ash-tree, such as may be seen in
those parts at this day.</p>

<p>Buttermere was said to allow its priest whittle-gate, and
twenty shillings yearly; by other accounts, "clogg-shoes,
harden-sark, whittle-gate, and guse-gate"&mdash;that is, a pair of
shoes clogged or iron-shod, a shirt of coarse linen or hemp
once a year, free-living at each parishioner's house for a certain
number of days, and the right to pasture a goose or geese on
the common.</p>

<p>The Wytheburn reader had sark, whittle-gate, and guse-gate.</p>

<p>The Mungrisdale priest had £6. 0<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i> a year.</p>

<p>Many worthies have appeared, nevertheless, among these
unpretending ministers of the dales; most prominently so,
Robert Walker, for a long period curate of Seathwaite, and
surnamed for his many virtues and industry, the Wonderful:
of whose life and actions an interesting and detailed account
is given in the Notes in Wordsworth's Works.</p>

<p>The Chapel of Martindale, a perpetual curacy under the
vicarage of Barton, near Penrith, was served for 67 years by
a Mr. Richard Birket. The ancient endowment was only
£2. 15<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> per annum, a small house, and about four acres
of land. At his first coming, Birket's whole property consisted
of two shirts and one suit of clothes; yet he amassed a
considerable sum of money. Being the only man except one
in the parish who could write, he transcribed most of the law
papers of his parishioners. Whenever he lent money, he
deducted at the time of lending, two shillings in the pound
for interest, and the term of the loan never exceeded a year.
He charged for writing a receipt twopence, and for a
promissory note fourpence; and used other means of extortion.
He likewise taught a school, and served as parish-clerk; and
in both these offices he showed his wonderful turn for economy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>and gain; for his quarter-dues from his scholars being small,
he had from the parents of each scholar a fortnight's board
and lodging; and the Easter-dues being usually paid in eggs,
he, at the time of collecting, carried with him a board, in
which was a hole that served him as a gauge, and he positively
refused to accept any which would pass through. He got a
fortune of £60 with his wife; to whom he left at his decease
the sum of £1200. Clark says, that on account of transacting
most of the law affairs of his parishioners, he was called Sir
Richard, or the Lawyer. But with reference to this title,
Nicholson, Bishop of Carlisle, at the beginning of the 18th
century says, "Since I can remember, there was not a reader
in any chapel who was not called 'Sir.'" The old designation
of the clergy before the Reformation was always "Sir";
knight being added as the military or civil distinction.
It has also been stated that the last curate of this parish, or of
these parts at all, called "Sir," was the Reverend Richard
Birket (apud 1689).</p>

<p>On the death of Mr. Birket no one would undertake the
cure, on account of the smallness of the stipend: those therefore
of the parishioners who could read, performed the service
by turns. Things remained in this situation for some time;
at length a little decrepid man, named Brownrigg, to whom
Mr. Birket had taught a little Latin and Greek, was by the
parishioners appointed perpetual Reader. For this they
allowed him, with the consent of the Donee, the church perquisites,
then worth about £12 per annum. Brownrigg being
a man of good character, and there being no clergyman within
several miles to baptize their children, or bury their dead, the
parishioners petitioned the Bishop to grant him deacon's
orders; this was accordingly done, and he served the cure
forty-eight years.</p>

<p>Mr. Mattinson, the curate of Paterdale, who died about the
year 1770, was a singular character. For fifty-six years he
officiated at the small "chapel with the yew tree," at the foot
of St. Sunday's Crag. His ordinary income was generally
twelve pounds a year, and never above eighteen. He married
and lived comfortably, and had four children, all of whom he
christened and married, educating his son to be a scholar, and
sending him to College. He buried his mother; married his
father and buried him; christened his wife, and published his
own banns of marriage in the church. He lived to the age of
ninety-six, and died worth a thousand pounds. It has been
alleged that this provident curate assisted his wife to card and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>spin the tithe wool which fell to his lot, viz. one third; that
he taught a school which brought him in about five pounds a
year; that his wife was skilful and eminent as a midwife, performing
her functions for the small sum of one shilling; but
as according to ancient custom she was likewise cook at the
christening dinner, she received some culinary perquisites
which somewhat increased her profits. Clarke adds, "One
thing more I must beg leave to mention concerning Mrs.
Mattinson: On the day of her marriage, her father boasted
that his two daughters were married to the two best men in
Paterdale, the priest and the bag piper."</p>

<p>In Langdale, in Clark's time, the poor Curate was obliged
to sell ale to support himself and his family; and, he says,
"At his house I have played <i>Barnaby</i> with him on the
Sabbath morning, when he left us with the good old song,</p>

<p>
'I'll but preach, and be with you again.'"<br />
</p>

<p>Taking all their circumstances into consideration, it is not
to be wondered at that the personal failings of these men were
looked upon by their neighbours with a leniency which would
hardly be intelligible elsewhere. Not very long ago an
excellent old dame only recently deceased, who for her
intelligence and goodness was respected and esteemed by
the highest and the lowest, and was one of the finest specimens
of nature's gentlewomen to be found anywhere, was heard
warmly upholding the character of a neighbouring clergyman
in these words,&mdash;"Well, I'll not say but he may have <i>slanted</i>
now and then, at a christenin' or a weddin'; but for buryin' a
corp, he is undeniable!"</p>

<p>In 1866 the Bishop of Carlisle consecrated a new church
at Wythop on the shores of Bassenthwaite Lake. The old
building which this edifice is intended to supersede is a decayed
barn-like structure, supplied with a bell which hung from an
adjoining tree. Some curious customs are associated with
this Church. It was built in 1473. For some hundreds of
years the inhabitants of the Chapelry were in the habit of
dividing it into four quarters, from each of which a representative
was elected yearly; the functions of the four being set
forth in a document dated 1623. They have to elect a parish
minister or reader, who was generally the schoolmaster, a
layman being eligible; they had to collect "devotion money,"
supervise the repairs of the fabric, and look after the parish
school. The stipend of the minister was 10&frac12;d. per Sunday.
Here is a copy of an old receipt:&mdash;"Received of the chapelmen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>of Wythop the sum of 28s. 5d. for thirty-one weeks'
reading wages, by me, John Fisher." The stipend was
however supplemented by Whittlegate; he was boarded and
lodged by the inhabitants of the four quarters in turn. The
value of the living at the present day is only £51 per annum.</p>

<p>This old church which is to remain as a curiosity, stands
high on a mountain side; and not many years ago nettles
grew luxuriantly beneath the seats in the pews and along the
middle of the passage. A narrow board on a moveable bracket
constitutes the communion table, and the vessels employed in
the celebration of the Lord's Supper are a pewter cheese-plate
and pewter pot. There is no font provided for baptisms, the
purpose was served by a common earthenware vessel; nor is
any vestry room attached to the building.</p>

<p>Vestries are seldom to be found in these remote chapels.
And in the chapel at Matterdale, the sacramental wine used
to be kept in a wooden keg, or small cask; perhaps is so
still.</p>

<p>It is said of Whitbeck Chapel, which lies on the base of
Black Combe, near the sea shore, that smugglers frequenting
that exposed part of the coast, on many occasions deposited
their illegal cargoes within its walls, until a convenient opportunity
arose for removing them unobserved. Sunday sometimes
came round when the sacred edifice was not in the most suitable
condition for celebrating divine service. The parish clerk had
then to advise the minister that it would be inconvenient to
officiate on that day. It was not politic to scrutinize too
closely the nature of the difficulty that existed: it was
sufficiently understood. A substantial sample of the intruding
contraband element found its way to the house of the minister;
and forthwith due notice was circulated among the parishioners
that the usual service would not be held until the Sunday
following. Meanwhile the stores were disposed of, and the
wild and desperate adventurers were in full career again
towards the Manx or Scottish shore.</p>

<p>In 1300 the Lady of Allerdale, and of the Honour of
Cockermouth, Isabel Countess of Albemarle was summoned
to prove by what right she held a market at Crosthwaite (near
Keswick). She denied that she held any market there, but
said that the men of the neighbourhood met at the Church on
Festival days, and there sold flesh and fish; and that she as
lady of the Manor of Derwent Fells took no toll. This
practice being persevered in, in 1306 the inhabitants of
Cockermouth represented in a petition to parliament that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>was a great concourse of people every Sunday at Crosthwaite
Church, where corn, flour, beans, peas, linen, cloth, meat,
fish, and other merchandise were bought and sold, which was
so very injurious to the market at Cockermouth, that the
persons of that place who farmed the tolls of the king were
unable to pay their rent. Upon this a prohibitory proclamation
was issued against the continuance of such an unseemly usage.</p>

<p>Things had not got quite straight in this respect within the
sanctuary at a much later period. The Rev. Thos. Warcup,
incumbent of the parish church of Wigton, in the civil war
was obliged to fly on account of his loyalty to the sovereign.
After the restoration of Charles II. he returned to his cure;
and tradition says, that the butcher-market was then held upon
the Sunday, and the butchers hung up their carcasses even at
the church door, to attract the notice of their customers as
they went in and came out of church; and it was not an
unfrequent thing to see people, who had made their bargains
before prayer began, hang their joints of meat over the
backs of the seats until the pious clergyman had finished the
service. The zealous priest, after having long, but ineffectually,
endeavoured to make his congregation sensible of the
indecency of such practices, undertook a journey to London,
on foot, for the purpose of petitioning the king to have the
market-day established on the Tuesday; which favour it is
said he had interest enough to obtain.</p>

<p>This faithful priest long before his death caused his own
monument to be erected in the churchyard, with this inscription
in verse of his own composing:</p>

<div class="poem">
Thomas Warcup prepar'd this stone,<br />
To mind him of his best home.<br />
Little but sin and misery here,<br />
Till we be carried on our bier.<br />
Out of the grave and earth's dust,<br />
The Lord will raise me up, I trust;<br />
To live with Christe eternallie,<br />
Who, me to save, himself did die.<br />
</div>

<div class="center">
Mihi est Christus et in vita et in morte lucrum. Phil. i. 21.<br />
Obiit anno 1653.<br />
</div>

<p>Thus it appears his decease did not take place until some
years after the date at which he records his death; probably
a period marked by some important change in his life, or of
unusual solemnity reminds us that only thirty-five years ago,
at a very few miles from its base, one who served the pastoral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>office more than fifty years, eking out a wretched maintenance
upon a small farm; while his sons were at the plough, was
of necessity compelled to send his daughters with horses and
carts for coals and lime, and to lead manure to the fields and
distribute it over the land; whilst the Dean and Chapter of
his diocese were the patrons of his cure.</p>

<p>Such things can hardly be witnessed at this day. But a
minister may be seen even now (1867) on the other side of the
district, leading the choir in the aisle, in his surplice, with
bow and fiddle in his hands, and then resuming his place at
the desk, with becoming solemnity, until the course of the
service requires his instrument again. His sense of harmony
is acute; for in the middle of the psalm, his arms will fly
apart, and the volume of sound be stopped, until an offensive
note has been ejected, and the strain rectified, and renewed.</p>

<p>A curious discovery has recently been made in the venerable
parish church of Windermere. The plaster having come away
over one of the arches, a band of red and black was revealed.
On the removal of more of the thick layers of whitewash, a
beautiful inscription in old English characters was found.
Further search was instituted, and similar inscriptions have
been discovered on all the walls between the arches in the
nave. It is conjectured that these inscriptions were placed in
the church at the time of the Reformation, as they are mostly
directed against the dogma of transubstantiation, whilst they
give plain instructions in the doctrine of the Sacraments.</p>

<p>On the north side of the nave the following have been
deciphered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Howe many sacramentes are their?&mdash;Two: baptisme and
the supper of the Lord.</p>

<p>"In baptisme which ys ye signe yt may be seene?&mdash;Water
onelie.</p>

<p>"Which is ye grace yt cannot be seene?&mdash;The washinge
awaie of synnes by the bloode of Christe.</p>

<p>"In the Lordes supper which is ye signe yt may be sene?&mdash;Breade
and Wyne.</p>

<p>"Which is ye grace yt cannot be seene?&mdash;The bodie and
bloode of Christe."</p>

<p>On the south wall the inscriptions are as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>"In goinge to ye table of the Lord, what ought a man to
consider or doe pryncipalie?&mdash;T examine him selfe.</p>

<p>"Is the breade and wine turned into ye bodie and bloode
of Christe?&mdash;No, for if you turne or take away ye signe that
may be sene it is no sacrament.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>"For the strengthenynge of your faith, howe many things
learne yow in ye Lordes Supper?&mdash;Two: as by ye hand and
mouthe, my bodie receiuth breade and wine: so by faithe, my

all ye benefittes of Christ his passion and his righteousness,

them.</p>

<big>SONGS AND BALLADS</big><br />
By JOHN JAMES LONSDALE,<br />
Author of "The Ship Boy's Letter," "Robin's Return," &amp;c.<br />
WITH A BRIEF MEMOIR.<br />
</div>


<div class="center"><i>From the ATHENÆUM.</i></div>

<p>Mr. Lonsdale's songs have not only great merit, but they
display the very variety of which he himself was sceptical.
His first lay, "Minna," might lay claim even to imagination;
nevertheless, for completeness and delicacy of execution, we
prefer some of his shorter pieces. Of most of these it may be
said that they are the dramatic expressions of emotional ideas.
In many cases, however, these songs have the robust interest
of story, or that of character and picture. When it is borne
in mind that by far the greater portion of these lays were
written for music, no small praise must be awarded to the
poet, not only for the suitability of his themes to his purpose,
but for the picturesqueness and fancy with which he has
invested them under difficult conditions.</p>

<div class="center"><i>From the WESTMINSTER REVIEW.</i></div>

<p>Poetry seems now to flourish more in the north than in the
south of England. Not long ago we noticed an admirable
collection of Cumberland ballads, containing two songs by
Miss Blamire, which are amongst the most beautiful and
pathetic in our language. We have now a small volume by
a Cumberland poet, which may be put on the same shelf with
Kirke White. Like Kirke White's, Mr. Lonsdale's life seems
to have been marked by pain and disappointment. Like
Kirk White too, he died before his powers were full developed.
A delicate pathos and a vein of humour characterize his best
pieces.</p>

<div class="center"><i>From the SPECTATOR.</i></div>

<p>"The Children's Kingdom" is really touching. The picture
of the band of children setting out in the morning bright and
happy, lingering in the forest at noon, and creeping to their
journey's end at midnight with tearful eyes, has a decided
charm.</p>

<div class="center"><i>From NOTES AND QUERIES.</i></div>

<p>A volume containing some very pleasing poems by a young
Cumberland poet, who but for his early death, would probably
have taken a foremost place amongst the lyrists of our day.</p>

OF FURNESS (North Lancashire), with Illustrative
Quotations, principally from the Old Northern Writers.
By <span class="smcap">J. P. Morris</span>, F.A.S.L.</p></blockquote>


<p>We are thoroughly pleased with the creditable way in which
Mr. Morris has performed his task. We had marked a number
of words, the explanation of which struck us as being good
and to the point, but space unfortunately fails us. We commend
the Furness Glossary to all students of our dialects.&mdash;<i>Westminster
Review.</i></p>

<p>The collection of words is remarkably good, and Mr. Morris
has most wisely and at considerable pains and trouble illustrated
them with extracts from old writers.&mdash;<i>The Reliquary Quarterly
Review.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Morris is well known in the district, both as a writer
and an antiquarian. His labours in the work before us evince
him to be a zealous and untiring student. We trust his book
will have the success which we think it well deserves.&mdash;<i>Ulverston

writers, and to all curious philologists.&mdash;<i>Carlisle Patriot.</i></p>

<p>She was an anomaly in literature. She had far too modest an
opinion of herself; an extreme seldom run into, and sometimes,
as in this case, attended like other extremes with disadvantages.
We are inclined, however, to think that if we have
lost a great deal by her ultra-modesty, we have gained something.
Without it, it is questionable whether she would have
abandoned herself so entirely to her inclination, and left us
those exquisite lyrics which derive their charms from the
simple, undisguised thoughts which they contain. The characteristic
of her poetry is its simplicity. It is the simplicity
of genuine pathos. It enters into all her compositions, and is
perhaps preeminent in her Scottish songs.&mdash;<i>Carlisle Journal, 1842.</i></p>

<p>In her songs, whether in pure English, or in the Cumbrian
or Scottish dialect, she is animated, simple, and tender, often
touching a chord which thrills a sympathetic string deep in
the reader's bosom. It may, indeed, be confidently predicted
of several of these lyrics, that they will live with the best
productions of their age, and longer than many that were at
first allowed to rank more highly.&mdash;<i>Chambers' Journal, 1842.</i></p>

we hold Anderson to be unequalled, not in Cumberland only,
but in England. As a description of a long, rapid, and varied
succession of scenes&mdash;every one a photograph&mdash;occurring at a
gathering of country people intent upon enjoying themselves
in their own uncouth roystering fashion, given in rattling,

itself a concentration of uproarious fun and revelry, we have
